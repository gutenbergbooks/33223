<h2>PREFACE AND EXPLANATION.</h2>

<p>To <span class="smcaplc">TEACH LEARNERS</span> those organic conditions which indicate character, is
the first object of this manual; and in order to render it accessible to
all, it condenses facts and conditions, rather than elaborates
arguments&mdash;because to <span class="smcaplc">EXPOUND</span> Phrenology is its highest proof&mdash;states laws
and results, and leaves them upon their naked merits; embodies recent
discoveries; and crowds into the fewest possible words and pages just what
learners need to know; and, hence, requires to be <span class="smcaplc">STUDIED</span> rather than
merely read. &#8220;Short, yet clear,&#8221; is its motto. Its numerous illustrative
engravings give the results of very extensive professional observations
and experience.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcaplc">RECORD CHARACTER</span> is its second object. In doing this, it describes
those organic conditions which affect and indicate character in <span class="smcaplc">SEVEN</span>
degrees of power&mdash;large, very large, full, average, moderate, small, and
very small, and refers those who have their physiological and
phrenological conditions correctly marked in the accompanying tables, to
those paragraphs which both describe themselves, and also contain specific
directions how to <span class="smcaplc">PERFECT THEIR</span> characters and improve children. Its plan
for recording character is seen at a glance in the following</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">EXPLANATION OF THE TABLES.</p>

<p>Those physiological and phrenological conditions marked <span class="smcaplc">LARGE</span> have a
powerful and almost <span class="smcaplc">CONTROLLING</span> influence over feelings and conduct, both
single and in combination, and engross weaker ones into their service.
<span class="smcap">Very large</span> organic conditions are sovereign kings over character and
conduct, and singly and in combination with each other, or with large
organs, direct and sway their possessor. <span class="smcap">Full</span> organs play subordinate
parts, yet are seen and felt, and exert more real than apparent influence.
<span class="smcap">Average</span> ones have considerable, yet a limited influence, but it is mainly
in <span class="smcaplc">COMBINATION</span> with large ones though they affect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> character more than
they seem to. <span class="smcap">Moderate</span> faculties are below par in fact, and still more so
in appearance; exert a limited influence; and leave character defective in
these respects. <span class="smcap">Small</span> organs are so deficient as easily to be perceived;
leave their possessor weak and faulty in these points; and should be
assiduously cultivated; while <span class="smcaplc">VERY SMALL</span> ones render him almost idiotic in
these functions.</p>

<p>This table is so constructed as to record the <span class="smcaplc">ACTUAL POWER</span>, or quality and
quantity of the physical and mental functions, as deduced from size and
activity combined, and this is done by means of dots or written figures
placed opposite the names of the organs and temperaments, and the printed
figures in the squares thus marked, designate the number of the page in
this work which contains the corresponding description of character; and
these paragraphs, thus referred to in the body of the work, have figures
attached to them, referring to the pages of &#8220;Fowler&#8217;s Phrenology,&#8221; where
an elaborate description of the several functions are discussed at length,
with numerous combinations which shade and tone the character.</p>

<p>The six left hand columns refer to the pages of this work, while the two
right hand ones refer to those <span class="smcaplc">NUMBERED PARAGRAPHS</span> found throughout
&#8220;Physiology,&#8221; &#8220;Self-Culture,&#8221; and &#8220;Memory,&#8221; which contain directions for
cultivating, restraining, and rightly directing whatever physical
functions or mental faculties may require either, both in adults and
children; so that these works, in conjunction with a correct marking in
these tables, furnish a complete directory for obviating faults, supplying
defects, developing excellencies, and perfecting one&#8217;s self and children.</p>

<p>Faculties marked with an upward curve, thus, &#8994;, in the several
squares, are deficient, and require cultivation; while those marked with a
downward curve, thus, &#8995;, are liable to excess or perversion, and
should be carefully guarded and rightly directed; while + signifies about
one third larger; and &mdash; one third smaller than a dot would indicate in
the same place, thus rendering one scale equal to twenty-one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">MARKING THE CHART BY FIGURES.</p>

<p>Some persons who record examinations prefer to use numerals to indicate
the size of the organs. We describe the organs in seven degrees of power,
and to indicate those degrees, employ the written figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7. When thus used, 1 means <span class="smcaplc">VERY SMALL</span>; 2, <span class="smcaplc">SMALL</span>;
3, <span class="smcaplc">MODERATE</span>; 4, <span class="smcaplc">AVERAGE</span>; 5, <span class="smcaplc">FULL</span>;
6, <span class="smcaplc">LARGE</span>; 7, <span class="smcaplc">VERY LARGE</span>. The signs +, &mdash;, &#8994;,
&#8995;, mean the same as in the above table.</p>

<h1>THE SELF-INSTRUCTOR.</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SECTION I.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS AFFECTING AND INDICATING CHARACTER.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">I.&mdash;VALUE OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Knowledge</span> is power&#8221;&mdash;to accomplish, to enjoy&mdash;and these are the only ends
for which man was created. <span class="smcap">All</span> knowledge confers this power. Thus, how
incalculably, and in how many ways, have recent discoveries in chemistry
enhanced human happiness, of which the lucifer match furnishes a <i>home</i>
example. Increasing knowledge in agriculture is doubling the means of
human sustenance. How immeasurably have modern mechanical improvements
multiplied, and cheapened all the comforts of life. How greatly have
steamboats and railroads added to the former stock of human success and
pleasures. Similar remarks apply to all other kinds of knowledge, and as
it increases from age to age will it proportionally multiply all forms of
human happiness. In fact, its inherent <i>nature</i> and legitimate effect is
to promote every species of enjoyment and success. Other things being
equal, those who know most, by a law of things, can both accomplish and
enjoy most; while ignorance instead of being bliss, is the greatest cause
of human weakness, wickedness, and woe. Hence, to <span class="smcaplc">ENLIGHTEN</span> man, is <i>the</i>
way to reform and perfect him.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcaplc">SELF</span>-knowledge is, of all its other kinds, both the most useful and
promotive of personal and universal happiness and success. &#8220;Know thyself&#8221;
was written, in golden capitals, upon the splendid temple of Delphos, as
the most important maxim the wise men of Greece could transmit to unborn
generations; and the Scriptures wisely command us to &#8220;search our own
hearts.&#8221; Since all happiness flows from obeying, and all pain from
violating, the <span class="smcaplc">LAWS OF OUR BEING</span>, to know our own selves is to know these
laws, and becomes the first step in the road of their obedience, which is
life. Self-knowledge, by teaching the laws and conditions of life and
health, becomes the most efficacious means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> prolonging the former and
increasing the latter&mdash;both of which are <i>paramount</i> conditions of
enjoying and accomplishing. It also shows us our natural talents,
capabilities, virtues, vices, strong and weak points, liabilities to err,
etc., and thereby points out, unmistakably, those occupations and spheres
in which we can and cannot succeed and shine; and develops the laws and
conditions of human and personal virtue and moral perfection, as well as
of vice, and how to avoid it. It is, therefore, the quintessence of all
knowledge; places its possessor upon the very acme of enjoyment and
perfection; and bestows the highest powers and richest treasures mortals
can possess. In short, to know ourselves perfectly, is to know every law
of our being, every condition of happiness, and every cause of suffering;
and to <i>practice</i> such knowledge, is to render ourselves as perfectly
happy, throughout every department of our being, as we can possibly be and
live. And since nothing in nature stands alone, but each is reciprocally
related to all, and all, collectively, form one magnificent whole&mdash;since
all stars and worlds mutually act and react upon each other, to cause day
and night, summer and winter, sun and rain, blossom and fruit; since every
genus, species, and individual throughout nature is second or sixteenth
cousin to every other; and since man is the epitome of universal nature,
the embodiment of all her functions, the focus of all her light, and
representative of all her perfections&mdash;of course to understand <i>him</i>
thoroughly is to know <i>all</i> things. Nor can nature be studied
advantageously without him for a text-book, nor he without her.</p>

<p>Moreover, since man is composed of mind <i>and</i> body, both reciprocally and
most intimately related to each other&mdash;since his mentality is manifested
only by bodily organs, and the latter depends wholly upon the former, of
course his mind can be studied only through its <span class="smcaplc">ORGANIC</span> relations. If it
were manifested independently of his physiology, it might be studied
separately, but since all his organic conditions modify his mentality, the
two must be studied <span class="smcaplc">TOGETHER</span>. Heretofore humanity has been studied by
piece-meal. Anatomists have investigated only his organic structure, and
there stopped; and mental philosophers have studied him metaphysically,
wholly regardless of all his physiological relations; while theologians
have theorized upon his moral faculties alone; and hence their utter
barrenness, from Aristotle down. As if one should study nothing but the
trunk of a tree, another only its roots, a third its leaves, or fruit,
without compounding their researches, of what value is such piecemeal
study? If the physical man constituted one whole being, and the mental
another, their separate study might be useful; but since all we know of
mind, and can do with it, is manifested and done wholly by means of
physical instruments&mdash;especially since every possible condition and change
of the physiology correspondingly affects the mentality&mdash;of course their
<span class="smcaplc">MUTUAL</span> relations, and the laws of their <span class="smcaplc">RECIPROCAL</span> action, must be
investigated <i>collectively</i>. Besides, every mental philosopher has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
deduced his system from his own closet cogitations, and hence their
babel-like confusion. But within the last half century, a new star, or
rather sun, has arisen upon the horizon of mind&mdash;a sun which puts the
finger of <span class="smcaplc">SCIENTIFIC CERTAINTY</span> upon every mental faculty, and discloses
those <i>physiological</i> conditions which affect, increase or diminish,
purify or corrupt, or in any other way modify, either the mind itself, or
its products&mdash;thought, feeling, and character&mdash;and thereby reduces mental
study to that same <i>tangible</i> basis of <i>proportion</i> in which all science
consists; leaving nothing dark or doubtful, but developing the true
<span class="smcaplc">SCIENCE OF MIND</span>, and the laws of its action. Of this, the greatest of all
discoveries, Gall was the author, and Phrenology and Physiology the
instruments which conjointly embrace whatever appertains to mind, and to
man, in all his organic relations, show how to perfect the former by
improving the latter, and disclose specific <span class="smcaplc">SIGNS OF CHARACTER</span>, by which
we may know ourselves and our fellow-men with certainty&mdash;a species of
knowledge most delightful in acquisition, and valuable in application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">2.&mdash;STRUCTURE CORRESPONDS WITH CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Throughout universal nature, the structure of all things is powerful or
weak, hard or soft, coarse or fine, etc., in accordance with its
functions; and in this there is a philosophical fitness or adaptation.
What immense power of function trees put forth, to rear and sustain aloft,
at such great mechanical disadvantage, their ponderous load and vast
canvas of leaves, limbs, and fruit or seeds, spread out to all the
surgings of tempestuous winds and storms; and the <i>texture</i> of wood is as
compact and firm as its functional power is prodigious. Hence its value as
timber. But tender vegetables, grains, etc., require little power, and
accordingly are fragile in structure. Lions, tigers, hyenas, and all
powerfully strong beasts, have a correspondingly powerful organic
structure. The muscular strength of lions is so extraordinary, that
seizing wild cattle by the neck, they dash through thicket, marsh, and
ravine, for hours together, as a cat would drag a squirrel, and their roar
is most terrific; and so powerful is their structure, that it took Drs.
McClintock, Allen, myself, and two experienced &#8220;resurrectionists,&#8221; <span class="smcaplc">FOUR
HOURS</span>, though we worked with might and main, just to cut off a magnificent
Numidian lion&#8217;s head. So hard and tough were the muscles and tendons of
his neck, that cutting them seemed like severing wire, and after slitting
all we could, we were finally obliged to employ a powerful purchase to
start them. It took over three hard days&#8217; work to remove his skin. So
compact are the skins of the elephant, rhinoceros, alligator, and some
other animals of great muscular might, that rifle-balls, shot against
them, flatten and fall at their feet&mdash;their structure being as dense as
their strength is mighty&mdash;while feeble animals have a correspondingly soft
structure. In like manner, the flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> of strong persons is dense and most
elastic, while those of weakly ones are flabby, and yield to pressure.</p>

<p>Moreover, fineness of texture manifests exquisiteness of sensibility, as
seen by contrasting human organism and feelings with brutes, or
fine-haired persons with coarse-haired. Of course, a similar relation and
adaptation exist between all other organic characteristics and their
functions. In short, it is a <span class="smcaplc">LAW</span> as philosophical as universal, that the
structure of all beings, and of each of their organs, corresponds
perfectly with their functions&mdash;a law based in the very nature and fitness
of things, and governing all shades and diversities of organization and
manifestation. Accordingly those who are coarse-skinned are coarse in
feeling, and coarse-grained throughout; while those finely organized are
fine-minded, and thus of all other textures of hair, skin, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">3.&mdash;SHAPE CORRESPONDS WITH CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Matter, in its primeval state, was &#8220;without form, and void,&#8221; or gaseous,
but slowly condensing, it solidified or <span class="smcaplc">CRYSTALLIZED</span> into minerals and
rocks&mdash;and all rocks and minerals are crystalline&mdash;which, decomposed by
sun and air, form soil, and finally assume organic, or animal and
vegetable forms. All crystals assume <i>angular</i> forms, and all vegetables
and animals those more or less <i>spherical</i>, as seeds, fruits, etc., in
proportion as they are lower or higher in the creative scale; though other
conditions sometimes modify this result.</p>

<p>Nature also manifests certain types of character in and by corresponding
types of form. Thus all trees bear a general resemblance to all other
trees in growth and general character, and also in shape; and those most
nearly allied in character approximate in shape, as pine, hemlock, firs,
etc., while every tree of a given kind is shaped like all others of that
kind, in bark, limb, leaf, and fruit. So all grains, grasses, fruits, and
every bear, horse, elephant, and human being bear a close resemblance to
all others of its kind, both in character and configuration, and on this
resemblance all scientific classification is based. And, since this
general correspondence exists between all the divisions and subdivisions
into classes, genera, and species of nature&#8217;s works, of course the
resemblance is perfect between <i>all the details</i> of outward forms and
inward mental characteristics; for this law, seen to govern nature in the
outline, must of course govern her in all her minutest details; so that
every existing outward shape is but the mirrored reflection of its inner
likeness. Moreover, since nature always clothes like mentalities in like
shapes, as oak, pine, apple, and other trees, and all lions, sheep, fish,
etc., in other general types of form, of course the more nearly any two
beings approximate to each other in mental disposition, do they resemble
each other in shape. Thus, not only do tiger form and character always
accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> each other, but leopards, panthers, cats, and all feline
species resemble this tiger shape more or less closely, according as their
dispositions approach or depart from his; and monkeys approach nearer to
the human shape, and also mentality, than any other animal except
orang-outangs, which are still more human both in shape and character, and
form the connecting link between man and brute. How absolute and
universal, therefore, the correspondence, both in general outline and
minute detail, between shape and character. Hence the shape of all things
becomes a sure index of its mentality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">4.&mdash;RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN HUMAN AND ANIMAL PHYSIOGNOMY AND CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Moreover, some men closely resemble one or another of the animal species
in both looks and character; that is, have the eagle, or bull-dog, or lion
or baboon expression of face, and when they do, have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> corresponding
characteristics. Thus the lion&#8217;s head and face are broad and stout built,
with a heavy beard and mane, and a mouth rendered square by small front
and large eye teeth, and its corners slightly turning downward; and that
human &#8220;Lion of the North&#8221;&mdash;who takes hold only of some great undertaking,
which he pursues with indomitable energy, rarely pounces on his prey, but
when he does, so roars that a nation quakes; demolishes his victim; and is
an intellectual king among men&mdash;bears no slight physiognomical resemblance
in his stout form, square face and mouth, large nose, and open
countenance, to the king of beasts.</p>

angles; and human beings thus physiognomically characterized, are fierce,
domineering, revengeful, most enterprising, not over humane, a terror to
enemies, and conspicuous somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bull-dogs</span>, generally fleshy, square-mouthed&mdash;because their tusks project
and front teeth retire&mdash;broad-headed, indolent unless roused, but then
terribly fierce, have their correspondent men and women, whose growling,
coarse, heavy voices, full habit, logy yet powerful motions, square face,
down-turned corners of mouth, and general physiognomical cast betoken
their second-cousin relationship to this growling, biting race, of which
the old line-tender at the Newburgh dock is a sample.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swine</span>&mdash;fat, logy, lazy, good-dispositioned, flat and hollow-nosed&mdash;have
their cousins in large-abdomened, pud-nosed, double-chinned, talkative,
story-enjoying, beer-loving, good-feeling, yes, yes, humans, who love some
easy business, and hate <span class="smcaplc">HARD</span> work.</p>

<p>Horses, oxen, sheep, owls, doves, snakes, and even frogs, etc., also have
their men and women cousins, together with their accompanying characters.</p>

<p>These resemblances are more difficult to describe than to recognize; but
the forms of mouth, nose, and chin, and sound of voice, are the best basis
of observation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">5.&mdash;BEAUTIFUL, HOMELY, AND OTHER FORMS.</p>

<p>In accordance with this general law, that shape is as character,
well-proportioned persons have harmony of features, and well-balanced
minds; whereas those, some of whose features stick right out, and others
fall far in, have uneven, ill-balanced characters, so that homely,
disjointed exteriors indicate corresponding interiors, while
evenly-balanced and exquisitely formed men and women have well-balanced
and susceptible mentalities. Hence, women, more beautiful than men, have
finer feelings, and greater perfection of character, yet are less
powerful&mdash;and the more beautifully formed the woman the more exquisite and
perfect her mentality. True, some handsome women often make the greatest
scolds, just as the sweetest things, when soured, become correspondingly
sour. The finest things, when perverted, become the worst. These two
extremes are the worst tempered&mdash;those naturally beautiful and fine
skinned, become so exquisitely organized, that when perverted they are
proportionally bad, and those naturally ugly-formed, become ugly by
nature.</p>

<p>Yet ordinary-looking persons are often excellent dispositioned,
benevolent, talented, etc., because they have a few <span class="smcaplc">POWERFUL</span> traits, and
also features&mdash;the very thing we are explaining; that is, they have
<span class="smcaplc">EXTREMES</span> alike of face and character. Thus it is that every diversity of
character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> has its correspondence in both the organic texture and
physiognomical form. To elucidate this subject fully we must explain
another law, that of</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">6.&mdash;HOMOGENEOUSNESS, OR ONENESS OF STRUCTURE.</p>

<p>Every part of every thing bears an exact correspondence to that thing <span class="smcaplc">AS A
WHOLE</span>. Thus, tall-bodied trees have long branches and leaves, and
short-bodied trees, short branches and roots; while creeping vines, as the
grape, honey-suckle, etc., have long, slim roots that run under ground as
extensively as their tops do above. The Rhode Island greening is a large,
well-proportioned apple, and its tree is large in trunk, limb, leaf, and
root, and symmetrical, while the gillifleur is conical and its tree long
limbed and even high to a peak at the top, while flat and broad-topped
trees bear wide, flat, sunken-eyed apples. Very thrifty growing trees, as
the Baldwin, fall pippin, Bartlet, black Tartarian, etc., generally bear
large fruit, while small fruit, as the seckle pear, lady apple, bell de
choisa cherry, grow slowly, and have many small twigs and branches.
Beautiful trees that bear red fruit, as the Baldwin, etc., have red inner
bark; while yellow and green-colored fruits grow on trees the inner rind
of whose limbs is yellow or green. Peach-trees, that bear early peaches,
have deeply-notched leaves, and the converse of late ones; so that, by
these and other physiognomical signs, experienced nurserymen can tell what
a given tree is at first sight.</p>

<p>In accordance with this law of unity of structure, long-handed persons
have long fingers, toes, arms, legs, bodies, heads, and phrenological
organs; while short and broad-shouldered persons are short and
broad-handed and fingered, faced, nosed, and limbed, and wide and low
bodied. When the bones on the hand are prominent, all the bones, nose
included, are generally so, and thus of all other characteristics of the
hand and any other part of the body. Hence, let a hand be thrust through a
hole, and I will tell the general character of its owner, because if it is
large or small, hard or soft, strong or weak, firm or flabby,
coarse-grained or fine-textured, even or prominent, rough or smooth,
small-boned or large-boned, or whatever else, his whole body is built upon
the same principle, with which his brain and mentality also correspond.
Hence small-nosed persons have little soul, and large-nosed a great deal
of character of some kind; large nostrils indicate powerful lungs and
bodies; while narrow nostrils indicate weak ones. Flat noses indicate flat
minds, and prominent noses strong points of character; sharp noses, keen,
clear intellects and intense feelings; blunt noses, obtuse minds; long
noses, long heads; hollow noses, tame characters; finely-formed noses,
well-proportioned character, etc.; and thus of every part of the body. And
it is meet philosophical, accordant with the principles of adaptation,
that this should be thus; and renders observations on character easy and
correct. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> general, too, tall persons have high heads, and are more
aspiring, aim high, and seek conspicuosity, while short ones have flat
heads, and seek worldly pleasures. Tall persons are rarely mean, though
often grasping; but very penurious persons are often broad built. Small
persons generally have exquisite mentalities, yet less power; while great
men are rarely dwarfs, though great size often co-exists with
sluggishness. To particularize&mdash;there are four leading forms which
indicate generic characteristics, all existing in every one, yet in
different <span class="smcaplc">DEGREES</span>. They are these:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">7.&mdash;THE BROAD, OR VITAL STRUCTURE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcaplc">THE VITAL, OR ANIMAL TEMPERAMENT.</span></p>

<p class="center">No. 3. <span class="smcap">Hall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus, Indian ponies are broad built or thick set, and accordingly very
tough, hardy, enduring of labor, and tenacious of life, yet less active
and nimble. Bull-dogs, elephants, and all round-favored animals and men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
also illustrate this law. Rotundity, with a moderate-sized head, indicates
ancestral longevity; and, unless health has been abused, renders it
possessor strong constitutioned, slow to ripen, or better as they grow
older; full of animal life; self-caring; money-making; fond of animal
pleasures; good feeling, yet spirited when roused; impulsive; more given
to physical than mental action; better adapted to business than study, and
talking than writing; more eloquent than argumentative; wide rather than
high or long headed; more glowing than cool in feeling; and more
enthusiastic than logical or deep. The preceding likeness represents this
class, and his ancestors exceeded 100. He has never been sick; can endure
any thing, and can never sit much in doors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">8.&mdash;THE MUSCULAR, OR POWERFUL TEMPERAMENT,</p>

<p>Gives projecting features, bones, noses, eyebrows, etc., with distinctness
of muscle; and renders its possessors strong; tough; thorough-going;
forcible; easy, yet powerful of motion; perhaps slow, but very stout;
strongly marked, if not idiosyncratic; determined; and impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> both
physically and mentally, who stamp their character on all they touch, of
whom Alexander Campbell is a good example.</p>

<p class="center">9.&mdash;THE LONG, OR ACTIVE FORM,</p>

<p>Gives <span class="smcaplc">ACTIVITY</span>. Thus the gazelle, deer, greyhound, weasel, and all long and
slim animals, are sprightly, light-motioned, agile, quick, nimble, and
full of action; and those persons thus formed are restless, wide awake,
always doing, eager, uncommonly quick to think and feel, sprightly in
conversation, versatile in talent, flexible, suggestive, abounding in
idea, apt at most things; exposed to consumption, because their action
exceeds their strength, early ripe, brilliant, and liable to premature
exhaustion and disease, because the mentality predominates over the
vitality; of which Captain Knight, of the ship &#8220;New World,&#8221; who has a
world-wide reputation for activity, enterprise, daring, impetuousness,
promptness, judgment, earnestness of execution, affability, and
sprightliness, furnishes a good example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">10.&mdash;THE SHARP AND ANGULAR, OR MENTAL ORGANIZATION,</p>

<p>Have ardent desires; intense feelings; keen susceptibilities; enjoy and
suffer in the extreme; are whole-souled; sensitive; positive in likes and
dislikes; cordial; enthusiastic; impulsive; have their hobbies; abound in
good feeling, yet are quick-tempered; excitable; liable to extremes; too
much creatures of feeling, and have a great deal of what we call SOUL, or
passion, or warmth of feeling. This temperament prevails in <span class="smcaplc">BRILLIANT</span>
writers or speakers, who are too refined and sensitive for the mass of
mankind. They gleam in their career of genius, and are liable to burn out
their vital powers on the altar of nervous excitability, and like Pollok,
H. K. White, McDonald Clarke, or Leggett, fall victims to premature death.
Early attention to the physical training of children would spare to the
world the lives and usefulness of some of the brightest stars in the
firmament of science.</p>

<p class="center">11.&mdash;COMBINATIONS OF TEMPERAMENT.</p>

<p>These shapes, or structures, called temperaments, however, never exist
separately; yet since all may be strong, or all weak, or either
predominant or deficient, of course their <span class="smcaplc">COMBINATIONS</span> with each other and
with the Phrenology exert potent influences over character, and put the
observer in possession of both the outline and the inner temple of
character.</p>

<p>Breadth of organization gives endurance, animal power, and animal
feelings; and sharpness gives intensity of action, along with mind as mind
and the two united, give both that rapidity and clearness of mind and that
intense glow of feeling which make the orator. Accordingly, all truly
eloquent men will be found to be broad built, round-shouldered, portly,
and fleshy, and yet rather sharp-featured. Of these, Sidney Smith
furnishes a sample.</p>

<p>His nose indicates the sharpness of the mental temperament, and his
fullness of face the breadth of the animal&mdash;the blending of which gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
that condensation of fervor and intellectuality which make him Sidney
Smith. Intensity of feeling is the leading element of good speaking, for
this excites feeling, and moves the masses. Wirt had this temperament. It
predominates in Preston, and in every man noted for eloquence.</p>

<p>The sharp and broad, combined with smallness of stature, is still more
susceptible, yet lacks strength. Such will be extremely happy, or most
miserable, or both, and are liable to die young, because their action is
too great for their endurance.</p>

<p>The vital mental, or broad and sharp, gives great power of constitution,
excellent lungs and stomach, strong enjoying susceptibilities, intense
love of pleasure, a happy, ease-loving cast of body and mind; powerful
passions, most intense feelings, and a story and song-loving disposition,
and, with large Tune, superior singing powers. This is, <span class="smcaplc">PAR EXCELLENCE</span>,
the singing temperament. It also loves poetry and eloquence, and often
executes them. Of this organism, its accompanying character, Dempster,
furnishes an excellent example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class="smcap">The Vital Motive Apparatus</span>, or powerful and animal temperament, is
indicated by the broad and prominent in shape, and renders its possessor
of good size and height, if not large; well-proportioned;
broad-shouldered; muscular; nose and cheek-bones prominent; visage
strongly marked; features often coarse and homely; countenance stern and
harsh; face red; hair red or sandy, if not coarse; and movements strong,
but often awkward, and seldom polished. He will be best adapted to some
laborious occupation, and enjoy hard work more than books or literary
pursuits; have great power of feeling, and thus require much
self-government; possess more talent than he exhibits to others, manifest
his mind more in his business, in creating resources and managing matters,
than in literary pursuits or mind as such; and improve with age, growing
better and more intellectual as he grows older; and manufactures as much
animal steam as he can work off, even if he works all the time hard. Such
men <span class="smcaplc">ACCOMPLISH</span>; are strong-minded; sensible; hard to beat; indomitable;
often impulsive; and strong in passion when once aroused; as well as often
excellent men. Yet this temperament is capable of being depraved,
especially if the subject drinks. Sailors usually have this temperament,
because fresh air and hard work induce it.</p>

<p>One having the mental temperament predominant, the motive full or large,
and the vital average to full, will differ in build from the preceding
description only in his being smaller, taller in proportion, and more
spare. He will have a reflective, thinking, planning, discriminating cast
of mind; a great fondness for literature, science, and intellectual
pursuits of the deeper, graver kind; be inclined to choose a professional
or mental occupation; to exercise his body much, but his mind more; will
have a high forehead; good moral faculties; and the brain developed more
from the root of the nose, over to Philoprogenitiveness, than around the
ears. In character, also, the moral and intellectual faculties will
predominate. This temperament is seldom connected with depravity, but
generally with talent, and a manifestation, not only of superior talents,
but of the solid, metaphysical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> reasoning, investigating intellect; a
fondness for natural philosophy, the natural sciences, etc. It is also the
temperament for authorship and clear-headed, labored productions. It
predominates in Revs. Jonathan Edwards, Wilbur Fiske, N. Taylor, E. A.
Parke, Leonard Bacon, Albert Barnes, Oberlin, and Pres. Day; Drs. Parish
and Rush; in Hitchcock, Jas. Brown, the grammarian, ex-U.S.
Attorney-General Butler, Hugh I. White, Wise, Asher Robbins, Walter Jones,
Esq., of Washington, D.C., Franklin, Alex. Hamilton, Chief-Justice
Marshall, Calhoun, John Q. Adams, Percival, Noah Webster, Geo. Combe,
Lucretia Mott, Catherine Waterman, Mrs. Sigourney, and nearly every
distinguished author and scholar. The accompanying engraving of William
Cullen Bryant furnishes as excellent an illustration of the shape that
accompanies this temperament, as his character does of its accompanying
mentality.</p>

Such are best fitted for some light, active business, requiring more

<p><span class="smcap">The Organs that accompany given Temperaments.</span>&mdash;Not only do certain
outlines of character and drifts of talent go along with certain kinds of
organizations, but certain phrenological developments accompany certain
temperaments. As the pepper secretes the smarting, the sugar-cane
sweetness, castor-beans and whales, oil, etc., throughout nature, so
certain temperaments secrete more brain than others; and some, brain in
particular regions of the head; and others, brain in other regions of the
head&mdash;but all form most of those organs best adapted to carry out those
characteristics already shown to accompany the several temperaments. Thus,
the vital or animal temperament secretes brain in the neighborhood of the
ears, so that along with breadth of body goes that width of head which
gives that full development of the animal organs which is required by the
animal temperament. Thus, breadth of form, width of head, and animality of
temperament and character, all go together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prominence</span> of organization, or the motive or powerful temperament, gives
force of character, and secretes brain in the crown of the head, and over
the eyes, along with Combativeness, Destructiveness, Appetite, and
Acquisitiveness. These are the very organs required by this temperament;
for they complete that force which embodies the leading element of this
organization. I never saw this temperament unaccompanied with prodigious
Firmness, and great Combativeness and perceptives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mental Vital.</span>&mdash;The finest and most exquisite organization is that
which unites the mental in predominance with the animal, the prominent
retiring. In this case, the person is rather short, the form light, the
face and person full, and the hair brown or auburn, or between the two. It
will sometimes be found in men, but much oftener in women. It is the
feeling, sentimental, exalted, angelic temperament; and always imparts
purity, sweetness, devotion, <ins class="correction" title="original: exquisitensess">exquisiteness</ins>, susceptibility, loveliness,
and great moral worth.</p>

<p>The phrenological organs which accompany this temperament, are&mdash;smaller
Firmness, deficient Self-Esteem, large or very large Approbativeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
smaller Destructiveness, Appetite not large, Adhesiveness and
Philoprogenitiveness very large, Amativeness fair; the head wide, not
directly round the ears, but at the upper part of the sides, including
Ideality, Mirthfulness, Sublimity, and Cautiousness; and a fine top head,
rising at Benevolence quite as much as at Firmness, and being wide on the
top, whereas the motive temperament gives perhaps a ridge in the middle of
the head, but not breadth on the top, and leaves the head much higher at
the back part than at Benevolence. Benevolence, however, often accompanies
the animal temperament, and especially that quiet goodness which grants
favors because the donor is too pliable, or too easy, to refuse them. But
for tenderness of sympathy, and whole-souled interest for mankind, no
temperament is equal to the vital mental. The motive mental, however, is
the one most common in reformers. The reason is this. The mentality
imparted by this temperament sees the miseries of mankind, and weeps over
them; and the force of character imparted by it pushes vigorously plans
for their amelioration. The outer portion of Causality, which plans, often
accompanies the animal temperament; the inner, which reasons, the motive
mental and mental.</p>

<p>The more perfect these organic conditions, the better. Greater breadth
than sharpness, or more vitality than action, causes sluggishness,
dullness of feeling, and inertness, while too great action for strength,
wears out its possessor prematurely. More prominence than sharpness,
leaves talents latent, or undeveloped, while predominant sharpness and
breadth, give such exquisite sensibilities, as that many things harrow up
all the finer sensibilities of keen-feeling souls. But when all are
powerful and <span class="smcaplc">EQUALLY BALANCED</span>, they combine all the conditions of power,
activity, and susceptibility; allow neither icy coldness, nor passion&#8217;s
burning heat, but unite cool judgment, intense but well-governed feelings,
great force of both character and intellect, and perfect consistency and
discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> with extraordinary energy; sound common sense, and far-seeing
sagacity, with brilliancy; and bestow the highest order of Physiology and
Phrenology. Such an organization and character were those of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>.</p>

<p>Besides these prominent signs of character, there are many others, among which,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">12.&mdash;THE LAUGH CORRESPONDS WITH THE CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Those who laugh very heartily, have much cordiality and whole-souledness
of character, except that those who laugh heartily at trifles, have much
feeling, yet little sense. Those whose giggles are rapid, but light, have
much intensity of feeling, yet lack power; whereas those who combine
rapidity with force in laughing, combine them in character. One of the
greatest workers I ever employed, I hired just because he laughed
heartily, and he worked just as he laughed. But a colored domestic who
laughed very rapidly, but <span class="smcaplc">LIGHTLY</span>, took a great many steps to do almost
nothing, and though she worked fast, accomplished little. Vulgar persons
always laugh vulgarly, and refined persons show refinement in their laugh.
Those who ha, ha, right out, unreservedly, have no cunning, and are
open-hearted in every thing; while those who suppress laughter, and try to
control their countenances in it, are more or less secretive. Those who
laugh with their mouth closed, are non-committal; while those who throw it
wide open, are unguarded and unequivocal in character. Those who,
suppressing laughter for a while, burst forth volcano-like, have strong
characteristics, but are well governed, yet violent when they give way to
their feelings. Then there is the intellectual laugh, the love laugh, the
horse laugh, the Philoprogenitive laugh, the friendly laugh, and many
other kinds of laugh, each indicative of corresponding mental
developments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">13.&mdash;THE WALK AS INDICATING CHARACTER.</p>

<p>As already shown, texture corresponds to character, and motion to texture,
and therefore to character. Those whose motions are awkward, yet easy,
possess much efficiency and positiveness of character, yet lack polish;
and just in proportion as they become refined in mind, will their mode of
carriage be correspondingly improved. A short and quick step, indicates a
brisk and active, but rather contracted mind, whereas those who take long
steps, generally have long heads; yet if their step be slow, they will
make comparatively little progress, while those whose step is <span class="smcaplc">LONG AND
QUICK</span>, will accomplish proportionately much, and pass most of their
competitors on the highway of life. Their heads and plans, too, will
partake of the same far-reaching character evinced in their carriage.
Those who sluff or drag their heels, drag and drawl in every thing; while
those who walk with a springing, bounding step, abound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> in mental snap and
spring. Those whose walk is mincing, affected, and artificial, rarely, if
ever, accomplish much; whereas those who walk carelessly, that is
naturally, are just what they appear to be, and put on nothing for outside
show. Those who, in walking, roll from side to side, lack directness of
character, and side every way, according to circumstances; whereas, those
who take a bee line&mdash;that is, whose body moves neither to the right nor
left, but straight forward&mdash;have a corresponding directness of purpose,
and oneness of character. Those also who tetter up and down when they
walk, rising an inch or two every step, will have many corresponding ups
and downs in life, because of their irregularity of character and feeling.
Those, too, who make a great ado in walking, will make much needless
parade in every thing else, and hence spend a great amount of useless
steam in all they undertake, yet accomplish little; whereas those who walk
easily, or expend little strength in walking, will accomplish great
results with a little strength, both mentally and physically. In short,
every individual has his own peculiar mode of moving, which exactly
accords with his mental character; so that, as far as you can see such
modes, you can decipher such outlines of character.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcaplc">DANCING</span>, these principles apply equally. Dr. Wieting, the celebrated
lecturer on physiology, once asked where he could find something on the
temperaments, and was answered, &#8220;Nowhere; but if I can ever see you among
men, I will give you a <span class="smcaplc">PRACTICAL</span> lesson upon it.&#8221; Accordingly, afterward,
chance threw us together in a hotel, in which was a dancing-school that
evening. Insisting on the fulfillment of our promise, we accompanied him
into the dancing saloon, and pointed out, first, a small, delicately
moulded, fine skinned, pocket-Venus, whose motions were light, easy,
waving, and rather characterless, who put forth but little strength in
dancing. We remarked&mdash;&#8220;She is very exquisite in feelings, but rather light
in the upper story, lacking sense, thought, and strength of mind.&#8221; Of a
large, raw-boned, bouncing Betty, who threw herself far up, and came down
good and solid, when she danced, we remarked&mdash;&#8220;She is one of your strong,
powerful, determined characters, well suited to do up rough work, but
utterly destitute of polish, though possessed of great force.&#8221; Others came
in for their share of criticism&mdash;some being all dandy, others all
business, yet none all intellect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">14.&mdash;THE MODE OF SHAKING HANDS</p>

<p>Also expresses character. Thus those who give a tame and loose hand, and
shake lightly, have a cold, if not heartless and selfish disposition,
rarely sacrificing much for others&mdash;probably conservatives, and lack
warmth of soul. But those who grasp firmly, and shake heartily, have a
corresponding whole-souledness of character, are hospitable, and will
sacrifice business to friends; while those who bow low when they shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
hands, add deference to friendship, and are easily led, for good or bad,
by friends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">15. THE MOUTH AND EYES PECULIARLY EXPRESSIVE OF CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Every mouth differs from every other, and indicates a coincident character.
Large mouths express a corresponding quantity of mentality, while small
ones indicate a lesser amount of mentality. A coarsely formed mouth
indicates power of character, while one finely formed indicates exquisite
susceptibilities. Hence small, delicately-formed mouths, indicate only
common minds, but very fine feelings, with much perfection of character.
Whenever the muscles about the mouth are distinct the character is
correspondingly positive, and the reverse. Those who open their mouths
wide and frequently, thereby evince an open soul, while closed mouths,
unless to hide deformed teeth, are proportionately secretive.</p>

<p>And thus of the eyes. In travelling west, in 1842, we examined a man who
made great pretension to religion, but was destitute of Conscience, whom
we afterward ascertained to be an impostor. While attending the Farmers&#8217;
Club, in New York, this scamp came in, and besides keeping his eyes half
closed half the time, frequently shut them so as to peep out upon those
present, but opened them barely enough to secure vision. Those who keep
their eyes half shut, are peekaboos and eavesdroppers, and those who use
squinting glasses are no better, unless they merely copy a foolish
fashion. The use of quizzing glasses indicates either defective sight or
defective mentalities, but are rarely if ever employed except as a
fashionable appendage.</p>

<p>Those, too, who keep their coats buttoned up, fancy high-necked and closed
dresses, etc., are equally non-communicative, but those who like open,
free, flowing garments, are equally open-hearted and communicative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">16.&mdash;INTONATIONS AS EXPRESSIVE OF CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Whatever makes a noise, from the deafening roar of sea, cataract, and
whirlwind&#8217;s mighty crash, through all forms of animal life, to the sweet
and gentle voice of woman, makes a sound which agrees perfectly with its
character. Thus the terrific roar of the lion, and the soft cooing of the
dove, correspond exactly with their respective dispositions; while the
rough and powerful bellow of the bull, the fierce yell of the tiger, the
coarse guttural moan of the hyena, and the swinish grunt, the sweet
warblings of birds, in contrast with the raven&#8217;s croak, and owl&#8217;s hoot,
each corresponds perfectly with their respective characteristics. And this
law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> holds equally true of man&mdash;that the human intonations are as superior
to brutal as human character exceeds animal. Accordingly, the
peculiarities of every human being are expressed in his voice, and mode of
speaking. Coarse-grained and powerfully animal organizations have a
coarse, harsh, and grating voice, while in exact proportion as persons
become refined, and elevated mentally, will their tones of voice become
correspondingly refined and perfected. We little realize how much of
character we infer from this source. Thus, some female friends are
visiting me transiently. A male friend, staying with me, enters the room,
is seen by my female company, and his walks, dress, manners, etc., closely
scrutinized, yet says nothing, and retires, leaving a comparatively
indistinct impression as to his character upon my female visitors,
whereas, if he simply said yes or no, the mere <span class="smcaplc">SOUND</span> of his voice
communicates to their minds most of his character, and serves to fix
distinctly upon their minds clear and correct general ideas of his
mentality.</p>

<p>The barbarous races use the guttural sounds, more than the civilized. Thus
Indians talk more down the throat than white men, and thus of those men
who are lower or higher in the human scale. Those whose voices are clear
and distinct have clear minds, while those who only half form their words,
or are heard indistinctly, say by deaf persons, are mentally obtuse. Those
who have sharp, shrill intonations have correspondingly intense feelings,
and equal sharpness both of anger and kindness, as is exemplified by every
scold in the world; whereas those with smooth, or sweet voices have
corresponding evenness and goodness of character. Yet contradictory as it
may seem, these same persons not unfrequently combine both sharpness and
softness of voice, and such always combine them in character. There is
also the intellectual, the moral, the animal, the selfish, the benignant,
the mirthful, the devout, the love, and many other intonations, each
accompanying corresponding peculiarities of characters. In short, every
individual is compelled, by every word he utters, to manifest something of
his true character&mdash;a sign of character as diversified as it is correct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">17.&mdash;HAIR, SKIN, ETC., AS INDICATING CHARACTER.</p>

<p>Coarseness of texture indicates a coarseness of function; while a fine
organization indicates a corresponding fineness of mentality. And since
when one part is coarse or fine, all are equally so, so, therefore,
coarseness of skin and hair indicate a coarse-grained brain, and
coarseness of mind; yet since coarseness indicates power, such persons
usually posses a great deal of character of some kind. Hence dark-skinned
nations are behind light-haired in all the improvements of the age, and
the higher, finer manifestations of humanity. So, too, dark-haired
persons, like Webster are frequently possessed of great power, yet lack
the finer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> more delicate shadings of sensibility and purity. Coarse
black hair and skin, or coarse red hair and face, indicate powerful animal
propensities, together with corresponding strength of character; while
fine and light hair indicate quick susceptibilities, together with purity,
refinement, and good taste. Fine dark or brown hair, indicates a
combination of exquisite susceptibilities with great strength of
character; while auburn-colored hair, and a florid countenance, indicate
the highest order of exquisiteness and intensity of feeling, yet with
corresponding purity of character and love of virtue, together with the
highest susceptibilities of enjoyment and suffering. And the intermediate
colors and textures indicate intermediate mentalities. Coarse-haired
persons should never turn dentists or clerks, but should seek some
out-door employment; and would be better contented with rough, hard work
than a light or sedentary occupation, although mental and sprightly
occupations would serve to refine and improve them; while dark and
fine-haired persons may choose purely intellectual occupations, and become
lecturers or writers with fair prospects of success. Red-haired persons
should seek out-door employment, for they require a great amount of air
and exercise; while those who have light, fine hair, should choose
occupations involving taste and mental acumen, yet take bodily exercise
enough to tone and vigorate their system.</p>

<p>Generally, whenever skin, hair, or features are fine or coarse, the others
are equally so. Yet some inherit fineness from one parent, and coarseness
from the other, while the color of the eye generally corresponds with that
of the skin, and expresses character. Light eyes indicate warmth of
feeling, and dark eyes power.</p>

<p>The mere expression of eye conveys precise ideas of the existing and
predominant states of the mentality and physiology. As long as the
constitution remains unimpaired, the eye is clear and bright, but becomes
languid and soulless in proportion as the brain has been enfeebled. Wild,
erratic persons, have a half-crazed expression of eye, while calmness,
benignancy, intelligence, purity, sweetness, love, lasciviousness, anger,
and all the other mental affections, express themselves quite as
distinctly in the eye as voice, or any other mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">18.&mdash;PHYSIOGNOMY.</p>

<p>Jackson Davis well remarked that, in the spirit land, conversation is
carried on mainly, not by words, but by <span class="smcaplc">EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE</span>&mdash;that
spirits <span class="smcaplc">LOOK</span> their thoughts and motions, rather than talk them. Certain it
is that the countenance discloses a greater amount of thought and feeling,
together with their nicer shades and phases, than words can possibly
communicate. Whether we will or no, we cannot <span class="smcaplc">HELP</span> revealing the innermost
recesses of our souls in our faces. By what means is this effected?
Clairvoyants say by magnetic centres, called poles; each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> physical and
mental organ has its pole stationed in a given part of the face, so that,
when such organ becomes active, it influences such poles, and contracts
facial muscles, which express the corresponding emotions. That there
exists an intimate relation between the stomach and one part of the face,
the lungs and another, etc., is proved by the fact that consumptive
patients always have a hectic flush on the cheek, just externally from the
lower portion of the nose, while inactive lungs cause paleness, and
healthy ones give the rosy cheek; and that dyspeptic patients are always
lank and thin opposite the double teeth, while those whose digestion is
good, are full between the corners of the mouth and lower portion of the
ears. Since, therefore, <span class="smcaplc">SOME</span> of the states of some of the internal organs
express themselves in the face, of course every organ of the body must do
the same&mdash;the magnetic pole of the heart beginning in the chin. Those
whose circulation is vigorous, have broad and rather prominent chins;
while those who are small and narrow-chinned have feeble hearts; and thus
all the other internal organs have their magnetic poles in various parts
of the face.</p>

<p>In like manner have all the <span class="smcaplc">PHRENOLOGICAL</span> organs. In 1841, Dr. Sherwood,
La Roy Sunderland, and O. S. Fowler, aided by a magnetic subject, located
the poles of most of the phrenological and physiological organs, some of
which were as follows: Acquisitiveness on each side of the middle portion
of the nose, at its junction with the cheek, causing breadth of nose in
proportion to the money-grasping instincts, while a narrow nose indicated
a want of the speculative turn. Firmness is in the upper lip, midway
between its edge and the nose, giving length, prominence, and a
compression of the upper lip. Hence, when we would exhort to determined
perseverance, we say, &#8220;Keep a stiff upper lip.&#8221; Self-Esteem has its pole
externally from that of Firmness, and between the outer portion of the
nose and the mouth, causing a fullness, as if a quid of tobacco were under
the upper lip. The affections were described as having their poles in the
edges of the lips, and hence the philosophy of kissing. The pole of
Mirthfulness is located externally, and above the outer corners of the
mouth, and hence the drawing up of these corners in laughter.
Approbativeness has its pole directly outward from these corners, and
hence the approbative laugh does not turn the corners of the mouth upward,
but draws them straight back, or outwardly. Like locations were assigned
to nearly all the other organs. That physiognomy has its science&mdash;that
fixed and absolute relations exist between the phrenological organs and
given portions of the face is not a matter of question. The natural
language of the organs, as seen in the attitudes of the head, indicate not
only the presence of large and active organs, but also the signs of their
deficiency. Self-Esteem throws the head upward and backward toward the
seat of its organ; Approbativeness, back and toward the side;
Philoprogenitiveness, directly back, but not upward;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> Firmness draws the
head up, in a stiff, perpendicular position; Individuality thrusts the
head forward toward its organ, and gives the man a staring, gazing aspect;
small Self-Esteem lets the head droop forward. Man was made both to
disclose his own character, and to read that of others. Than this form of
knowledge, none is more inviting or useful. Hence God has caused the
inherent character of every living being and thing to gush out through
every organ of the body, and every avenue of the soul; and also created in
both brute and man a character-reading faculty, to take intuitive
cognizance of the mental operations. Nor will she let any one lie, any
more than lie herself, but compels all to carry the flag of their
character at their mast-heads, so that all acquainted with the signs may
see and read. If we attempt deception, the very effort convicts us. If all
nature&#8217;s signs of character were fully understood, all could read not only
all the main characters of all they see, but even most thoughts and
feelings passing in the mind for the time being&mdash;a gift worth more than
Astor&#8217;s millions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">19.&mdash;REDNESS AND PALENESS OF FACE.</p>

<p>Thus far our remarks have appertained to the constant colors of the face,
yet those colors are often diversified or changed for the time being.</p>

<p>Thus, at one time, the whole countenance will be pale, at another, very
red; each of which indicates the existing states of body and mind. Or
thus; when the system is in a perfectly healthy state, the whole face will
be suffused with the glow of health and beauty, and have a red, but never
an inflamed aspect; yet any permanent injury of health, which prostrates
the bodily energies, will change this florid complexion into dullness of
countenance indicating that but little blood comes to the surface or flows
to the head and a corresponding stagnation of the physical and mental
powers. Yet, after a time, this dullness frequently gives way to a fiery
redness; not the floridness of health, but the redness of inflammation and
false excitement, which indicates a corresponding depreciation of the
mental faculties. Very red-faced persons, so far from being the most
healthy, are frequently the most diseased, and are correspondingly more
animal and sensual in character; because physiological inflammation
irritates the propensities more, relatively, than the moral and
intellectual faculties, though it may, for the time being, increase the
latter also. When the moral and intellectual faculties greatly predominate
over the animal, such redness of the face may not cause coarse animality,
because while it heightens the animal nature, it also increases the
intellectual and moral, which, being the larger, hold them in check, but
when the animal about equals the moral and intellectual, this inflammation
evinces a greater increase of animality than intellectuality and morality.
Gross sensualists, and depraved sinners, generally have a fiery, red
countenance. Stand aloof from them, for their passions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> are all on fire,
ready to ignite and explode on provocations so slight that a healthy
physiology would scarcely notice them. This point can hardly be more fully
intelligible; but let readers note the difference between a healthy
floridness of face, and the fiery redness of drunkards, debauchees,
meat-eaters, etc. Nor does an inflamed physiology merely increase the
animal nature, but gives a far more <i>depraved</i> and sensual cast to it,
thus doubly increasing the tendency to depravity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">20.&mdash;HEALTH AND DISEASE AS AFFECTING MENTALITY.</p>

<p>Health and disease affects the mind as much as body. Virtue, goodness,
etc., are only the healthy or normal exercise of our various faculties,
while depravity and sin are only the sickly exercise of these same organs.
Holiness and moral excellence, as well as badness, depend far less upon
the relative <span class="smcaplc">SIZE</span> of the phrenological organs, than upon their <span class="smcaplc">DIRECTION</span>
or tone and character, and this depends upon the <span class="smcaplc">STATE OF THE BODY</span>. Or
thus; a healthy physiology tends to produce a healthy action of the
phrenological organs, which is virtue and happiness; while an unhealthy
physiology produces that sickly exercise of the mental faculties,
especially of the animal propensities, which constitutes depravity and
produces misery. Hence those phrenologists who look exclusively to the
predominant <span class="smcaplc">SIZE</span> of the animal organs, for vicious manifestations, and
regard their average size as indicative of virtue, have this great lesson
to learn, that health of body produces health of mind and purity of
feelings, while all forms of bodily disease, in the very nature of things,
tend to corrupt the feelings and deprave the soul. While, therefore,
phrenologists should scrutinize the size of organs closely, they should
observe the <span class="smcaplc">STATE OF HEALTH</span> much more minutely, for most of their errors
are explainable on this ground: that the organs described produced vicious
inclinations, not because they were so large but because they were
physically <span class="smcaplc">SICK</span>, and hence take on a morally <span class="smcaplc">DEFORMED</span> mode of action.
Phrenologists, look ye well to these points, more fully explained in our
other phrenological works.</p>

<h2>SECTION II.</h2>
<h3>PHRENOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS INDICATING CHARACTER.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">21.&mdash;DEFINITION AND PROOF.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phrenology</span> points out those relations established by nature between given
developments and conditions of <span class="smcaplc">BRAIN</span> and corresponding manifestations of
<span class="smcaplc">MIND</span>. Its simple yet comprehensive definition is this: every faculty of
the mind is manifested by means of particular portions of the <span class="smcaplc">BRAIN</span> called
its organs, the size of which, other things being equal, is proportionate
to its power of function. For example: it teaches that parental love is
manifested by one organ, or portion of the brain; appetite by another,
reason by a third, etc., which are large the stronger these corresponding
mental powers.</p>

<p>Are, then, particular portions of the brain larger or smaller in
proportion as particular mental characteristics are stronger or weaker?
Our short-hand answer is illustrated by the following anecdote. A Mr.
Juror was once summoned to attend court, but died before its sitting. It
therefore devolved upon Mr. Simple to state to the court the reason of his
non-appearance. Accordingly, when Mr. Juror&#8217;s name was called, Mr. Simple
responded, &#8220;May it please the court, I have twenty-one reasons why Mr.
Juror is not in attendance. The first is, he is <span class="smcaplc">DEAD</span>. The second is&mdash;&#8221;
&#8220;That <span class="smcaplc">ONE</span> will answer,&#8221; responded the judge. &#8220;One such reason is amply
sufficient.&#8221; But few of the many proofs that Phrenology is true will here
be stated, yet those few are <span class="smcaplc">DECISIVE</span>.</p>

<p>First. <span class="smcap">The Brain is the Organ of the Mind.</span> This is assumed, because too
universally admitted to require proof.</p>

<p>Secondly. Is the brain, then, a <span class="smcaplc">SINGLE</span> organ, or is it a bundle of organs?
Does the <span class="smcaplc">WHOLE</span> brain think, remember, love, hate, etc.; or does one
portion reason, another worship, another love money, etc.? This is the
determining point. To decide it affirmatively, establishes Phrenology;
negatively, overthrows it. It is proved by the following facts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The exercise of different Functions simultaneously.</span>&mdash;We can walk, think,
talk, remember, love, and many other things all <span class="smcaplc">TOGETHER</span>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>&mdash;the mind
being, in this respect, like a stringed instrument, with several strings
vibrating at a time, instead of like a flute which stops the preceding
sound when it commences succeeding ones; whereas, if it were a single
organ, it must stop thinking the instant it began to talk, could not love
a friend and express that love at the same time, and could do but one
thing at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monomania.</span>&mdash;Since mental derangement is caused only by cerebral disorder,
if the brain were a single organ, the <span class="smcaplc">WHOLE</span> mind must be sane or insane
together; whereas most insane persons are deranged only on one or two
points, a conclusive proof of the plurality of the brain and mental
faculties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diversity of Talent</span>, or the fact that some are remarkable for sense, but
poor in memory, or the reverse; some forgetting names, but remembering
faces; some great mechanics, but poor speakers, or the reverse; others
splendid natural singers, but no mechanics, etc., etc., conducts us to a
similar conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Injuries of the Brain</span> furnish still more demonstrative proof. If
Phrenology be true, to wound and inflame Tune, for example, would create a
singing disposition; Veneration, a praying desire; Cautiousness,
groundless fears; and so of all the other organs. And thus it is. Nor can
this class of facts be evaded. They abound in all phrenological works,
especially periodicals, and drive and clench the nail of proof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Comparative Phrenology</span>, or the perfect coincidence existing between the
developments and characters of animals, constitutes the highest proof of
all. Since man and brute are fashioned upon one great model, those same
great optical laws governing the vision of both, that same principle of
muscular contraction which enables the eagle to soar aloft beyond our
vision, and the whale to furrow and foam the vasty deep, and enabling man
to walk forth in the conscious pride of his strength, and thus of all
their other common functions; of course, if man is created in accordance
with phrenological laws, brutes must also be; and the reverse. If, then,
this science is true of either, it must be true of both; must pervade all
forms of organization. What, then, are the facts?</p>

<p>Phrenology locates the animal propensities at the <span class="smcaplc">SIDES</span> of the head,
between and around the ears; the social affections in its <span class="smcaplc">BACK</span> and lower
portion; the aspiring faculties in its <span class="smcaplc">CROWN</span>; the moral on its <span class="smcaplc">TOP</span>; and
the intellectual on the <span class="smcaplc">FOREHEAD</span>; the perceptives, which, related to
matter, <span class="smcaplc">OVER THE EYES</span>; and the reflectives in the <span class="smcaplc">UPPER</span> part of the
forehead. (See cut No. 14.)</p>

<p>Now since brutes possess at least only weak moral and reflective
faculties, they should, if Phrenology were true, have little top head, and
thus it is. Not one of all the following drawings of animals, have much
brain in either the reflective or moral region. Almost all their mentality
consists of the <span class="smcaplc">ANIMAL PROPENSITIES</span>, and nearly all their brain is <span class="smcaplc">BETWEEN</span>
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> <span class="smcaplc">AROUND THEIR EARS</span>,
just where, according to Phrenology, it should be. Yet the skulls of all human beings rise high above the eyes and ears, and
are long on top, that is, have intellectual and moral <span class="smcaplc">ORGANS</span>, as we know
they possess these mental <span class="smcaplc">ELEMENTS</span>. Comparing the accompanying human skull
with those of brutes, thus those of snakes, frogs, turtles, alligators,
etc., slope straight back from the nose; that is, have almost no moral or
intellectual organs; tigers, dogs, lions, etc., have a little more, yet
how insignificant compared with man, while monkeys are between them in
these organs and their faculties. Here, then, is <span class="smcaplc">INDUCTIVE</span> proof of
Phrenology as extensive as the whole brute creation on the one hand,
contrasted with the entire human family on the other.</p>

<p>Again, Destructiveness is located by Phrenology over the ears, so as to
render the head wide in proportion as this organ is developed.
Accordingly, all carnivorous animals should be wide-headed at the ears;
all herbivorous, narrow. And thus they are, as seen in tigers, hyenas,
bears, cats, foxes, ichneumons, etc., compared with rabbits, sheep, etc.

bear additional testimony to the truth of phrenological science. They possess, in character, strong perceptive powers, but weak reflectives,

<p class="center">THE PHILOSOPHY OF PHRENOLOGY.</p>

<p>All truth bears upon its front unmistakable evidence of its divine origin,
in its philosophical consistency, fitness, and beauty, whereas all untruth
is grossly and palpably deformed. All truth, also, harmonizes with all
other truth, and conflicts with all error, so that to ascertain what is
true, and detect what is false, is perfectly easy. Apply this test,
intellectual reader to one after another of the doctrines, as presented in
this science. But enough on this point of proofs. Let us proceed to its
illustration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">22.&mdash;PHRENOLOGICAL SIGNS OF CHARACTER.</p>

<p>The brain is not only the organ of the mind, the dome of thought, the
palace of the soul, but is equally the organ of the <i>body</i>, over which it
exerts an all-potent influence for good or ill, to weaken or stimulate, to
kill or make alive. In short, the brain is the organ of the body in
general, and of all its organs in particular. It sends forth those nerves
which keep muscles, liver, bowels, and all the other bodily organs in a
high or low state of action; and, more than all other causes, invites or
repels disease, prolongs or shortens life, and treats the body as its
galley-slave. Hence, healthy cerebral action is indispensable to bodily
health. Hence, too, we walk or work so much more easily and efficiently
when we take an <i>interest</i> in what we do. Therefore those who would be
happy or talented must first and mainly keep their <span class="smcaplc">BRAIN</span> vigorous and
healthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>The brain is subdivided into two hemispheres, the right and left, by the
falciform process of the dura mater, a membrane which dips down one to two
inches into the brain, and runs from the root of the nose over to the nape
of the neck. This arrangement renders all the phrenological organs <span class="smcaplc">DOUBLE</span>.
Thus, as there are two eyes, ears, etc., that when one is diseased, the
other can carry forward the functions, so there are two lobes to each
phrenological organ, one on each side. The brain is divided thus: the
feelings occupy that portion commonly covered by the hair, while the
forehead is occupied by the intellectual organs. These greater divisions
are subdivided into the animal brain, located between and around the ears;
the aspiring faculties, which occupy the crown of the head; the moral and
religious sentiments, which occupy the top; the physico-perceptives,
located over the eyes; and the reflectives, in the upper portion of the
forehead. The predominance of these respective groups produces both
particular shapes, and corresponding traits of character. Thus, when the
head projects far back behind the ears, hanging over and downward in the
occipital region, it indicates very strong domestic ties and social
affections, a love of home, its relations and endearments, and a
corresponding high capacity of being happy in the family, and of making
the family happy. Very wide and round heads, on the contrary, indicate
strong animal and selfish propensities, while thin, narrow heads, indicate
a corresponding want of selfishness and animality. A head projecting far
up at the crown, indicates an aspiring, self-elevating disposition,
proudness of character, and a desire to be and to do something great;
while the flattened crown indicates a want of ambition, energy, and
aspiration. A head high, long, and wide upon the top, but narrow between
the ears, indicates Causality, moral virtue, much practical goodness, and
a corresponding elevation of character; while a low or narrow top head
indicates a corresponding deficiency of these humane and religious
susceptibilities. A head wide at the upper part of the temples, indicates
a corresponding desire for personal perfection, together with a love of
the beautiful and refined, while narrowness in this region evinces a want
of taste, with much coarseness of feeling. Fullness over the eyes
indicates excellent practical judgment of matters and things appertaining
to property, science, and nature in general; while narrow, straight
eyebrows, indicate poor practical judgment of matter, its quality,
relations, and uses. Fullness from the root of the nose upward, indicates
great practical talent, love of knowledge, desire to see, and ability to
do to advantage, together with sprightliness of mind; while a hollow in
the middle of the forehead indicates want of memory and inability to show
off to advantage. A bold, high forehead, indicates strong reasoning
capabilities, while a retiring forehead indicates less soundness, but more
availability of talent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">23.&mdash;THE NATURAL LANGUAGE OF THE FACULTIES.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig40after44.png" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">No. 40. <span class="smcap">Washington Irving.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Phrenology shows that every faculty, when active, throws head and body in
the direction of that faculty. Thus, intellect, in the fore part of the
head, throws it directly forward, and produces a forward hanging motion of
the head. Hence intellectual men never carry their heads backward and
upward, but always forward; and logical speakers move their heads in a
straight line, usually forward, toward their audience; while vain speakers
carry their heads backward. Perceptive intellect, when active, throws out
the chin and lower portions of the face; while reflective intellect causes
the upper portion of the forehead to hang forward, and draws in the chin,
as in the engravings of Franklin, Webster, and other great thinkers.
Benevolence throws the head and body slightly forward, leaning toward the
object which excites its sympathy; while Veneration causes a low bow,
which, the world over, is a token of respect; yet, when Veneration is
exercised toward the Deity, as in devout prayer, it throws the head
<span class="smcaplc">UPWARD</span>; and, as we use intellect at the same time, the head is generally
directed forward. Ideality throws the head slightly forward, and to one
side, as in Washington Irving, a man as gifted in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>taste and imagination
as almost any living writer; and, in his portraits, his finger rests upon
this faculty; while in Sterne, the finger rests upon Mirthfulness. Very
firm men stand straight up and down, inclining not a hair&#8217;s breadth
forward or backward, or to the right or left; hence the expression, &#8220;He is
an up-and-down man.&#8221; And this organ is located exactly on a line with the
body. Self-Esteem, located in the back and upper portion of the head,
throws the head and body upward and backward. Large feeling, pompous
persons, always walk in a very dignified, majestic posture, and always
throw their heads in the direction of Self-Esteem; whilst approbative
persons throw their heads backward, but to the one side or both. The
difference between these two organs being comparatively slight, only the
practical Phrenologist&#8217;s eye can perfectly distinguish them.</p>

<p class="center">No. 45. <span class="smcap">A conceited simpleton.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is, moreover, a natural language of money-loving, and that is a
leaning forward and turning of the head to one side, as if in ardent
pursuit of something, and ready to grasp it with outstretched arms; while
Alimentiveness, situated lower down, hugs itself down to the dainty dish
with the greediness of an epicure, better seen than described. The shake
of the head is the natural language of Combativeness, and means no, or I
resist you. Those who are combating earnestly upon politics, or any other
subject, shake the head more or less violently, according to the power of
the combative feeling, but always shake it slightly inclining <i>backwards</i>;
while Destructiveness, inclining forward, causes a shaking of the head
slightly forward, and turning to one side. When a person who threatens you
shakes his head violently, and holds it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> partially backward, and to one
side, never fear&mdash;he is only barking; but whenever he inclines his head to
one side, and shakes it violently, that dog will bite, whether possessed
of two legs or four. The social affections are located in the <i>back</i> part
of the head; and, accordingly, woman being more loving than man, when not
under the influence of the other faculties, usually inclines her head
backward toward the neck; and when she kisses children, and those whom she
loves, always turns the head directly backward, and rolls it from side to
side, on the back of the neck. Thus it is that all the various postures
assumed by it individually, are expressive of the present or the permanent
activity of their respective faculties.</p>

<p class="center">24.&mdash;ORGANIC TONE OR QUALITY OF BRAIN.</p>

<p>This condition modifies character more than any other. It is, indeed, the
summing up of all. It consists of two kinds, original and acquired. The
former, inherited from parents, embraces the pristine vigor and power with
which the life principle was started, and gives what we will call <span class="smcaplc">SNAP</span>;
while the latter embraces the <i>existing</i> states of the organism as
affected by health or debility, artificial habits&mdash;such as dyspeptic and
other affections, caused by injurious qualities and quantities of food, by
artificial stimulants, as tea, coffee, tobacco, or alcoholic drinks&mdash;the
deranged or healthy states of the nervous system; too much or too little
exercise, labor, sleep, breath, etc., etc.; and whatever other conditions
are embraced in health and disease, or in any way affect them. Of course,
the parental may be good, but acquired poor, or the reverse, according as
the subject is strengthening or enfeebling, building up or breaking down
his physical constitution, by correct or erroneous physiological habit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Yet, in most persons, the parental is many hundred per cent. better than
the acquired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parental good, or very good</span>, gives corresponding innate vigor and energy,
or that heart and bottom which wears like iron, and bends, willow-like,
without breaking, and performs more with a given size, than greater size,
and less inherent &#8220;snap;&#8221; and gives thoroughness and edge to the
mentality, just as good steel, well tempered, does to the tool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parental fair</span> gives a good share of the presiding qualities, yet nothing
remarkable; with acquired good endures and accomplishes much; without it,
soon breaks down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parental poor</span> leaves its subject poorly organized, bodily and mentally,
and proportionally low in the creative scale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acquired good</span> enables whatever of life power there is, to perform all of
which it is capable; with parental good, furnishes a full supply of vital
power, and that activity which works it all up in mental or physical
labor. With parental very good, puts forth a most astonishing amount of
effort, and endures wonders without injury; possesses remarkable clearness
and wholeness of mind; thinks and feels directly to the purpose; gives
point and cogency to every thing; and confers a superior amount of healthy
intellectuality, morality, and mentality, in general.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acquired fair</span>, with parental average, gives fair natural talents, and
mental and physical vigor, yet nothing remarkable; will lead a commonplace
life, and possess an every-day <ins class="correction" title="original: charcter">character</ins>, memory, etc.; will not set the
world on fire, nor be insignificant, but, with cultivation, will do well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acquired poor</span> will be unable to put forth its inherent power; is weak and
inefficient, though desirous of doing something; with parental good, may
take hold resolutely, but soon tires, and finds it impossible to sustain
that powerful action with which it naturally commences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">25.&mdash;STATES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</p>

<p>A good nervous condition enables its possessor to put forth sound and
healthy mental and physical efforts; gives a calm, quiet, happy, contented
frame of mind, and a strong tendency to enjoy every thing&mdash;even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> bad;
makes the most of life&#8217;s joys, and the least of its sorrows; confers full
possession of all its innate powers; and predisposes to a right exercise
of all the faculties.</p>

<p>Disordered nerves produce an irritated, craving, dissatisfied state of
mind, and a tendency to depravity in some of its forms, with a half
paralyzed, lax, inefficient state of mind and body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">26.&mdash;SIZE OF HEAD AS INFLUENCING CHARACTER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size</span> of head and organs, other things being equal, is the great
phrenological condition. Though tape measurements, taken around the head,
from Individuality to Philoprogenitiveness, give some idea of the size of
brain, the fact that some heads are round, others long, some low, and
others high, so modifies these measurements that they do not convey any
very correct idea of the actual quantity of brain. Yet these measurements
range somewhat as follows. Least size of adults compatible with fair
talents, 20&#188;; 20&#190; to 21&#188;, moderate; 21&#188; to 22, average; 22 to
22&#190;, full; 22&#190; to 23&#190;, large; above 23&#190;, very large. Female
heads, &#189; to &#190; below these averages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;One having a large sized brain, with activity <i>average</i>, will
<i>possess</i> considerable energy of intellect and feeling, yet seldom
manifest it, unless it is brought out by some powerful stimulus, and will
be rather too indolent to exert, especially his <i>intellect</i>: with activity
<i>full</i>, will be endowed with an uncommon amount of the mental power, and
be capable of doing a good deal, yet require considerable to awaken him to
that vigorous effort of mind of which he is capable; if his powers are not
called out by circumstances, and his organs of practical intellect are
only average or full, he may pass through life without attracting notice,
or manifesting more than an ordinary share of talent: but if the
perceptive faculties are strong, or very strong, and his natural powers
put in vigorous requisition, he will manifest a vigor and energy of
intellect and feeling quite above mediocrity; be adequate to undertakings
which demand originality of mind and force of character, yet, after all,
be rather indolent: with activity <i>great, or very great</i>, will combine
great <i>power</i> of mind with great activity; exercise a commanding influence
over those minds with which he comes in contact; when he enjoys, will
enjoy intensely, and when he suffers, suffer equally so; be susceptible of
strong excitement, and, with the organs of the propelling powers, and of
practical intellect, large or very large, will possess all the mental
capabilities for conducting a large business; for rising to eminence, if
not to pre-eminence; and discover great force of character and power of
intellect and feeling: with activity <i>moderate</i>, when powerfully excited,
will evince considerable energy of intellect and feeling, yet be too
indolent and too sluggish to do much; lack clearness and force of idea,
and intenseness of feeling; unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> literally driven to it, will not be
likely to be much or to do much, and yet actually <i>possess</i> more vigor of
mind, and energy of feeling, than he will manifest; with activity small,
or very small, will border upon idiocy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Large.</span>&mdash;One having a very large head, with activity <i>average</i> or
<i>full</i>, on great occasions, or when his powers are thoroughly roused, will
be truly great; but upon ordinary occasions, will seldom manifest any
remarkable amount of mind or feeling, and perhaps pass through life with
the credit of being a person of good natural abilities and judgment, yet
nothing more; with <i>great</i> activity and strength, and large intellectual
organs, will be a natural genius, endowed with very superior powers of
mind and vigor of intellect; and, even though deprived of the advantages
of education, his natural talents will surmount all obstacles, and make
him truly talented; with activity <i>very great</i>, and the organs of
practical intellect and of the propelling powers large, or very large,
will possess the first order of natural abilities; manifest a clearness
and force of intellect which will astonish the world, and a power of
feeling which will carry all before him; and, with proper cultivation,
enable him to become a bright star in the firmament of intellectual
greatness, upon which coming ages may gaze with delight and astonishment.
His mental enjoyment will be most exquisite, and his sufferings equally
keen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Full.</span>&mdash;One having a full-sized brain, with activity <i>great, or very
great</i>, and the organs of practical intellect and of the propelling powers
large, or very large, although he will not possess <i>greatness</i> of
intellect, nor a deep, strong mind, will be very clever; have considerable
talent, and that so distributed that it will show to be <i>more</i> than it
really is; is capable of being a good scholar, doing a fine business, and,
with advantages and application, of distinguishing himself somewhat; yet
he is inadequate to a great undertaking; cannot sway an extensive
influence, nor be really great; with activity <i>full, or average</i>, will do
only tolerably well, and manifest only a common share of talent; with
activity <i>moderate, or small</i>, will neither be nor do much worthy of
notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Average</span>, with activity great, manifests a quick, clear, sprightly mind and
off-hand talents; and is capable of doing a fair business, especially if
the stamina is good; with activity <i>very great</i>, and the organs of the
propelling powers and of practical intellect large, or very large, is
capable of doing a good business, and may pass for a man of fair talent,
yet will not be original or profound; will be quick of perception; have a
good practical understanding; will do well <i>in his sphere</i>, yet never
manifest greatness, and out of his sphere, be common-place; with activity
only <i>average</i>, will discover only an ordinary amount of intellect; be
inadequate to any important undertaking; yet, in a small sphere, or one
that requires only a mechanical routine of business, may do well; with
<i>moderate or small</i> activity, will hardly have common sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;One with a head of only moderate size,
combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> <i>great</i>
or <i>very great activity</i>, and the organs of the propelling powers and of
practical intellect large, will possess a tolerable share of intellect,
yet be more showy than sound; with others to plan for and direct him, will
execute to advantage, yet be unable to do much alone; will have a very
active mind, and be quick of perception, yet, after all, have a contracted
intellect; possess only a small mental calibre, and lack momentum, both of
mind and character; with activity only <i>average, or fair</i>, will have but a
moderate <i>amount</i> of intellect, and even this scanty allowance will be too
sluggish for action, so that he will neither suffer nor enjoy much; with
activity <i>moderate or small</i>, will be idiotic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small or Very Small.</span>&mdash;One with a small or very small head, no matter what
may be the activity of his mind, will be incapable of much intellectual
effort; of comprehending even easy subjects; or of experiencing much pain
or pleasure; in short, will be mentally imbecile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><ins class="correction" title="original: 47">27</ins>.&mdash;SIZE OF BRAIN AS AFFECTING MENTALITY.</p>

<p>Most great men have great heads. Webster&#8217;s head measures over 24 inches,
and Clay&#8217;s considerably above 23; and this is about Van Buren&#8217;s size;
Chief Justice Gibson&#8217;s, the greatest jurist in Pennsylvania, 24&#188;;
Napoleon&#8217;s reached nearly or quite to 24, his hat passing easily over the
head of one of his officers, which measured 23&#189;; and Hamilton&#8217;s hat
passed over the head of a man whose head measured 23&#189;. Burke&#8217;s head was
immense, so was Jefferson&#8217;s; while Franklin&#8217;s hat passed over the ears of
a 24-inch head. Small and average sized heads often astonish us by their
brilliancy and learning, and, perhaps, eloquence, yet they fail in that
commanding greatness which impresses and sways mind. The phrenological law
is that size, other things being equal, is a measure of power; yet these
other conditions, such as activity, power of motive, wealth, physiological
habits, etc., increase or diminish the mentality, even more than size.</p>

<p>Conjugal love; attachment to the opposite sex; desire to love, be loved,
and marry; adapted to perpetuate the race. It causes those mutual
attractions which exist between the sexes; creates love; induces marriage;
eventuates in offspring; renders woman winning, persuasive, urbane,
affectionate, loving, and lovely; and develops all the feminine charms and
graces; and makes man noble in feeling and bearing; elevated in
aspiration; tender and bland in manner; affectionate toward woman; pure in
feeling; highly susceptible to female charms; and clothes him with that
dignity, power, and persuasiveness, which accompanies the masculine.
Perverted, it occasions a grossness and vulgarity in expression and
action; licentiousness in all its forms; a feverish state of mind; and
depraves all the other propensities; treats the other sex merely as a
minister to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> passion; now caressing, and now abusing them; and renders the
love-feeling every way gross, animal, and depraved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Is strongly attracted toward the opposite sex; admires and loves
their beauty and excellencies; easily wins their affectionate regards, or
kindles their love; has many warm friends, if not admirers, among them;
loves young and powerfully, and wields a potent influence for good or evil
over the destinies of its subject, according as it is well or ill placed;
with Adhesiveness and Union for Life large, will mingle pure friendship
with devoted love; cannot flourish alone, but must have its matrimonial
mate, with whom it will be capable of becoming perfectly identified, and
whom it will invest with almost superhuman perfections, by magnifying
their charms and overlooking their defects; in the sunshine of whose love
it will be perfectly happy, but proportionally miserable without it; with
Ideality and the mental temperament large, will experience a fervor and
intensity of first love, amounting almost to ecstacy or romance; can marry
those only who combine refinement of manners with correspondingly strong
attachments; with Philoprogenitiveness and Benevolence also large, will be
eminently qualified to enjoy the domestic relations; to be happy in home,
and render home happy; with Inhabitiveness also large, will set a high
value on house and place, long to return home when absent, and consider
family and children as the greatest treasures of its being; with large
Conscientiousness, will keep the marriage relations inviolate, and regard
unfaithfulness as the greatest of sins; with Combativeness large, will
defend the objects of its love with great spirit, and resent powerfully
any indignity offered to them; with Alimentiveness large, will enjoy
eating with the family dearly; with Approbativeness large, cannot endure
to be blamed by those it loves; with Cautiousness and Secretiveness large,
will express love guardedly, and much less than it experiences; but with
Secretiveness small, will show, in every look and action, the full,
unveiled feeling of the mind; with Firmness and Self-Esteem large, will
sustain interrupted love with fortitude, yet suffer much damage of mind
and health therefrom; but with Self-Esteem moderate, will feel crushed and
broken down by disappointment; with the moral faculties predominant, can
love those only whose moral tone is pure and elevated; with predominant
Ideality, and only average intellectual faculties, will prefer those who
are showy and gay, to those who are sensible yet less beautiful; but with
Ideality less than the intellectual and moral organs, will prefer those
who are substantial and valuable more than showy; with Mirthfulness, Time,
and Tune, will love dancing, lively society, etc.: p. 57.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Large.</span>&mdash;Confers the strongest possible inclination to love; exercises
an absolute influence over character and conduct; must always have a
congenial spirit whom to love, and by whom to be loved; is capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> the
highest order of love, and is proportionally beautified thereby; can love
with complete devotedness, even under unfavorable circumstances, and has a
most important element for conjugal happiness and a matrimonial partner;
its combinations will be somewhat the same as those under Amativeness
large, allowance being made for the increased power of this faculty: p.
58.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Full.</span>&mdash;Possesses rather strong susceptibilities of love, and conjugal
affinity and unity to a congenial spirit; is capable of much purity,
intensity, and cordiality of love; with Adhesiveness and Benevolence
large, will render good service in the family; with <ins class="correction" title="original: Secretivness">Secretiveness</ins> large,
will manifest less love than it feels, and show little in promiscuous
society; with a highly susceptible temperament, will experience great
intensity of love, and evince a good degree of masculine or feminine
excellence: p. 59.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Average.</span>&mdash;Is capable of fair sexual attachments, and conjugal love,
provided it is properly placed and fully called out; experiences a greater
or less degree of love in proportion to its activity; renders the son
quite attached to mother and sisters, and fond of female society, and
endowed with a fair share of the masculine element, yet not remarkable for
its perfection, makes woman quite winning and attractive, yet not
particularly susceptible to love; renders the daughter fond of father and
brothers, and desirous of the society of men, yet not extremely so; and
capable of a fair share of conjugal devotedness under favorable
circumstances; combined with an ardent temperament, and large Adhesiveness
and Ideality, gives a pure and platonic cast of love, yet cannot
assimilate with a coarse temperament or a dissimilar Phrenology; is
refined, and faithful, yet has more friendship than passion; can love
those only who are just to its liking; with Cautiousness and Secretiveness
large, will express less love than it feels, and that equivocally and by
piecemeal, nor then till its loved one is fully committed; with
Cautiousness, Approbativeness and Veneration large, and Self-Esteem small,
will be diffident in promiscuous society, yet enjoy the company of a
select few of the opposite sex; with Adhesiveness, Benevolence, and
Conscientiousness large, and Self-Esteem small, will be kind and
affectionate in the family, yet not particularly fond of caressing or
being caressed; and will do much to make family happy, yet will manifest
less fondness and tenderness; with Order, Approbativeness, and Ideality
large, will seek in a companion personal neatness and polish of manners;
with full intellectual and moral faculties, will base its conjugal
attachments in the higher qualities of the affections, rather than their
personal attractiveness or strength of passion; but with a commonplace
temperament, and not so full moral and intellectual faculties, will be an
indifferent companion: p. 56.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;Will be rather deficient, though not palpably so in the love
element; show little desire to caress or be caressed; will love the mental
excellences of the other sex more than personal beauty, and find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
difficult to sympathize with a conjugal partner, unless the natural
harmony between the parties is well-nigh perfect; cares less for marriage,
and could live an unmarried life without inconvenience; can love but once,
and should marry only the first love, because the love-principle will not
be sufficiently strong to overcome the difficulties incident to a second
love, or the want of a congenial companion, and find more pleasure in
other things than in the matrimonial relations; with an excitable
temperament, will experience greater warmth and ardor, than depth and
uniformity of love; with Approbativeness large, will soon become alienated
from a lover by rebukes and fault-finding; with Adhesiveness and the moral
and intellectual faculties large, can become strongly attached to those
who are highly moral and intellectual, yet experiences no affinity for any
other, and to be happy in marriage, must base it in the higher faculties:
p. 59.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;Feels little conjugal or sexual love, and desire to marry; is
cold, coy, distant, and reserved toward the other sex; experiences but
little of the beautifying and elevating influence of love, and should not
marry, because incapable of appreciating its relations and making a
companion happy: p. 59.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Small.</span>&mdash;Is passively continent, and almost destitute of love: p. 60.</p>

<p>Parental love; attachment to one&#8217;s own offspring; love of children, pets,
and animals generally, especially those young or small; adapted to that
infantile condition in which man enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> the world, and to children&#8217;s need
of parental care and education. This faculty renders children the richest
treasure of their parents; casts into the shade all the toil and expense
they cause, and lacerates them with bitter pangs when death or distance
tears them asunder. It is much larger in woman than in man; and nature
requires mothers to take the principal care of infants. Perverted, it
spoils children by excessive fondness, pampering, and humoring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Loves its own children devotedly; values them above all price;
cheerfully endures toil and watching for their sake; forbears with their
faults; wins their love; delights to play with them, and cheerfully
sacrifices to promote their interests; with Continuity large, mourns long
and incessantly over their loss; with Combativeness, Destructiveness, and
Self-Esteem large, is kind, yet insists on being obeyed; with Self-Esteem
and Destructiveness moderate, is familiar with, and liable to be ruled by
them; with Firmness only average, fails to manage them with a steady hand;
with Cautiousness large, suffers extreme anxiety if they are sick or in
danger; with large moral and intellectual organs, and less Combativeness
and Destructiveness, governs them more by moral suasion than physical
force&mdash;by reason than fear&mdash;is neither <ins class="correction" title="original: two">too</ins> strict nor over-indulgent; with
Approbativeness large, values their moral character as of the utmost
importance; with Veneration and Conscientiousness large, is particularly
interested in their moral improvement; with large excitability,
Combativeness, and Destructiveness, and only average Firmness, will be, by
turns, too indulgent, and over-provoked&mdash;will pet them one minute, and
punish them the next; with larger Approbativeness and Ideality than
intellect, will educate them more for show than usefulness&mdash;more
fashionably than substantially&mdash;and dress them off in the extreme of
fashion; with a large and active brain, large moral and intellectual
faculties, and Firmness, and only full Combativeness, Destructiveness, and
Self-Esteem, is well calculated to teach and manage the young. It renders
farmers fond of stock, dogs, etc., and women fond of birds, lap-dogs, etc.;
girls fond of dolls, and boys of being among horses and cattle; and
creates a general interest in young and small animals: p. 62.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Large.</span>&mdash;Experiences the feeling above described with still greater
intensity and power; almost idolizes its children, grieves immeasurably at
their loss, and, with large Continuity, refuses to be comforted; with very
large Benevolence and only moderate Destructiveness, cannot bear to see
them punished, and, with only moderate Causality, is liable to spoil them
by over-indulgence; with large Approbativeness added, indulges parental
vanity and conceit; with large Cautiousness and disordered nerves, is
always cautioning them, and indulges a world of groundless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> apprehensions
about them with Acquisitiveness moderate, makes them many presents, and
lavishes money upon them, but with large Acquisitiveness lays up fortunes
for them; with large moral and intellectual organs, is indulgent, yet
loves them too well to spoil them, and does his utmost to cultivate their
higher <ins class="correction" title="original: faculties: etc.,">faculties, etc.,:</ins> p. 63.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Full.</span>&mdash;Loves its children well, yet not passionately&mdash;does much for them,
yet not more than is necessary&mdash;and with large Combativeness,
Destructiveness, and Self-esteem, is too severe, and makes but little
allowance for their faults; but with Benevolence, Adhesiveness, and
Conscientiousness large, does and sacrifices much, to supply their wants
and render them happy. Its character, however, will be mainly determined
by its combinations: p. 63.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Average.</span>&mdash;Loves its own children tolerably well, yet cares but little for
those of others; with large Adhesiveness and Benevolence, likes them
better as they grow older, yet does and cares little for infants&mdash;is not
duly tender to them, or forbearing toward their faults, and should
cultivate parental fondness, especially if Combativeness, Destructiveness,
and Self-Esteem are large, and conscience only moderate: p. 61.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;Is not fond enough of children; cannot bear much from them;
fails to please or take good care of them, particularly of infants; cannot
endure to hear them cry, or make a noise, or disturb his things; and with
an excitable temperament, and large Combativeness, is liable to punish
them for trifling offences, find much fault with them, and be sometimes
cruel; yet, with Benevolence and Adhesiveness large, may do what is
necessary for their comfort: p. 64.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;Cares little for its own children, and still less for those of
others; and with Combativeness and <ins class="correction" title="original: Destructivness">Destructiveness</ins> large, is liable to
treat them unkindly and harshly, and is utterly unqualified to have charge
of them: p. 64.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Small.</span>&mdash;Has little or no perceptible parental love, or regard for
children, but conducts toward them as the other faculties dictate: p. 64.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">3. ADHESIVENESS.</p>

<p>Friendship; social feeling; love of society; desire to congregate,
associate, visit, seek company, entertain friends, form and reciprocate
attachments, and indulge friendly feelings. When perverted, it forms
attachments for the low, vulgar, or vicious, and leads to bad company.
Adapted to man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> requisition for concert of action, co-partnership,
combination, and community of feeling and interest, and is a leading
element of his social relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Is a warm, cordial, ardent friend; readily forms friendships, and
attracts friendly regards in return; must have society of some kind; with
Benevolence large, is hospitable, and delights to entertain friends; with
Alimentiveness large, loves the social banquet, and sets the best before
friends; with Approbativeness large, sets the world by their commendation,
but is terribly cut by their rebukes; with the moral faculties large,
seeks the society of the moral and elevated, and can enjoy the friendship
of no others; with the intellectual faculties large, seeks the friendship
of the intelligent; with Language large, and Secretiveness small, talks
freely in company; and with Mirthfulness and Ideality also large, is full
of fun, and gives a lively, jocose turn to conversation, yet is elevated
and refined; with Self-Esteem large, leads off in company, and gives tone
and character to others; but with Self-Esteem small, receives character
from friends, and, with Imitation large, is liable to copy their faults as
well as virtues; with Cautiousness, Secretiveness, and Approbativeness

faculty inspires: p. 65.</p>

sacrifice much on the altar of friendship, yet offer up friendship on the

friends, yet it will be more from sympathy than affection; will have a few

<p class="center">A. UNION FOR LIFE.</p>

<p>Attachment to <span class="smcaplc">ONE</span>, and <span class="smcaplc">BUT ONE</span> conjugal partner for life. Adapted to the
pairing principle in man and animals, and is located between Adhesiveness
and Amativeness. Some birds, such as geese, eagles, robins, etc., pair for
life, and remain true to their connubial attachment; while hens, turkies,
sheep, horses, and neat cattle, associate promiscuously, which shows that
it is a faculty distinct from Amativeness and Adhesiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Large.</span>&mdash;Seeks one, and but one sexual mate; experiences the keenest
disappointment when love is interrupted; is perfectly satisfied with the
society of that one, and can truly love no other, and retains that love
even after its object is dead; may love and marry another, but it will be
more from motives of policy than pure conjugal union; and should exert
every faculty to win the heart and hand of the one beloved; nor allow any
thing to alienate their affections, because certain ruin to mind and body
is consequent thereon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very Large.</span>&mdash;Possesses the element of conjugal union, and flowing together
of soul, in the highest degree, and, with Continuity large, becomes
broken-hearted when disappointed, and comparatively worthless in this
world; seeks death rather than life; regards this union as the gem of
life, and its loss as worse than death; and should manifest the utmost
care to bestow itself only where it can be reciprocated for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Full.</span>&mdash;Can love cordially, yet is capable of changing its object,
especially if Continuity be moderate; will love for life provided
circumstances are favorable, yet will not bear every thing from a lover or
companion, and, if one love is interrupted, will form another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Average.</span>&mdash;Is disposed to love but one for life, yet is capable of changing
its object, and, with Secretiveness and Approbativeness large, and
Conscientiousness only full, is capable of coquetry, especially if
Amativeness is large, and Adhesiveness only full, and the temperament more
powerful than fine-grained; such should cultivate this faculty, and not
allow their other faculties to break their first love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moderate.</span>&mdash;Is somewhat disposed to love only once, yet allows other
stronger faculties to interrupt first love, and, with Amativeness large,
can form one attachment after another with comparative ease, yet is not
true as a lover, nor faithful to first love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small.</span>&mdash;Cares but little for first love, and seeks the promiscuous society
and affection of the opposite sex, rather than a single partner for life.</p>

be cognizable.</p>

Philoprogenitiveness, Adhesiveness, Individuality, and Locality large,

humming-bird like, flies rapidly from thing to thing, but does not stay

and violence, when thoroughly provoked; and with large or very large
Combativeness, acts like a chafed lion, and feels like rushing into the
midst of perilous dangers. Such persons should never strike, for they will
strike harder than they mean to, because it nerves the arm with unwonted
strength. This faculty tears up and destroys whatever is in its way; is
harsh and often morose in manner, and should cultivate pleasantness; with
large Combativeness, Firmness, Self-Esteem, and Approbativeness moderate,
is exceedingly repulsive, hating and hateful when angry, and is much more
provoked than occasion requires; with large intellectuals, puts forth
tremendous mental energy; and should offset this faculty by reason and

less; fails to realize or put forth its strength; and with large

well; and hence is liable to clog body and mind by over-eating; should
restrain appetite; will feel better by going without an occasional meal,
and is liable to dyspepsia. This faculty is liable to take on a diseased
action, and crave a much greater amount of food than nature requires, and
hence is the great cause of dyspepsia. Its diseased action may be known by
a craving, hankering, gone sensation before eating; by heart-burn, pain in
the stomach, belching of wind, a dull, heavy, or painful sensation in the
head, and a desire to be always nibbling at something; lives to eat,
instead of eating to live, and should at once be erased by omitting one
meal daily, and, in its stead, drinking abundantly of cold water.

<h2>RULES FOR FINDING THE ORGANS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Pre-eminently</span> is Phrenology a science of <span class="smcaplc">FACTS</span>. Observation discovered
it&mdash;observation must perfect it; observation is the grand instrumentality
of its propagation. To be convinced of its truth, nine hundred and
ninety-nine men out of every thousand require to <span class="smcaplc">SEE</span> it&mdash;to be convinced
by <span class="smcaplc">INDUCTION</span>, founded upon experiment. Hence the importance of giving
definite <span class="smcaplc">RULES</span> for finding the organs, by which even disbelievers may test
the science, and believers be confirmed in its truth, and advanced in its
study.</p>

<p>The best mode of investigating its truth, is somewhat as follows: You know
a neighbor who has extreme Firmness in character; who is as inflexible as
the oak, and as obstinate as the mule. Now, learn the location of the
phrenological organ of Firmness, and apply that location to his head&mdash;that
is, see whether he has this organ as conspicuous as you know him to have
this faculty in character; and if you find a coincidence between the two,
you have arrived at a strong phrenological fact.</p>

<p>You know another neighbor who is exceedingly cautious, timid, safe wise,
and hesitating; who always looks at the objections and difficulties in the
way of a particular measure, instead of at its advantages; who always
takes abundant time to consider, and is given to procrastination. Learn
the location of Cautiousness, and see whether he has this phrenological
organ as conspicuous as you know this faculty to exist in his character.
By pursuing such a course as this, you can soon arrive at a sure knowledge
of the truth or falsity of phrenological science; and this is altogether
the best mode of convincing unbelievers of its truth, by means of the
marked coincidence between the Phrenology and character of those they
know; and it is not possible for the human mind to resist proof like this.</p>

<p>To promote this practical knowledge&mdash;the application of this science&mdash;we
give the following <span class="smcaplc">RULES FOR FINDING</span> the organs, fully assured that we can
fill our pages with nothing more interesting or useful. Follow these rules
exactly, and you will have little difficulty in finding at least all the
prominent organs.</p>

<p>Your first observation should be made upon <span class="smcaplc">TEMPERAMENT</span>,
or organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and physiology, with this principle for your basis: that when bodily
texture or form is coarse, or strong, or fine, or soft, or weak, or
sprightly, the texture of the brain will correspond with that of body, and
the mental characteristics with that of brain. Still, it is not now our
purpose to discuss the influence of various temperaments upon the direction
of the faculties.</p>

<p>The second observation should be to ascertain what faculties <span class="smcaplc">CONTROL</span> the
character, or what is the dominant motive, desire, object, or passion of
the person examined; in phrenological language, what faculties predominate
in action; and it should here be observed, that the relative size of
organs does not always determine this point. Some faculties, though very
dominant in power, cannot, in their very nature, constitute a motive for
action, but are simply executive functions, simply carrying into effect
the dominant motives. For example, Combativeness rarely ever becomes a
distinct motive for action. Few men love simply to wrangle, quarrel, and
fight for fun, but they exercise Combativeness merely as a means of
obtaining the things desired by the other dominant faculties. Few men have
for their motive the mere exercise of will&mdash;that is, Firmness is generally
exercised to carry into effect the design of the other faculties; and
instead of subjecting the other faculties to itself, simply keeps them at
their work, whatever that work may be. And thus of some other faculties.
But Amativeness, Friendship, Appetite, Acquisitiveness, Benevolence,
Veneration, Conscientiousness, or Intellect, Constructiveness, Ideality,
or the observing faculties, may all become dominant motives. And it
requires much phrenological shrewdness to ascertain what single faculty,
cluster, or combination of faculties, leads off the character.</p>

<p>Let us take, then, for our starting point, the outer angle of the eye, and
draw a line to the middle of the top of the ears, and <span class="smcap">Destructiveness</span> is
exactly under this point, and it extends upward about half an inch above
the top of the ears, and in proportion to its size will the head be wide
between the ears. And if Secretiveness be small and Destructiveness large,
there will be a horizontal ridge extending forward and backward, more or
less prominent, according to the size of this organ.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an inch above the middle of the top of the ears,
<span class="smcap">Secretiveness</span> is located. When this organ is large, it rarely gives a
distinct projection, but simply fills and rounds out the head at this
point. When the head widens rapidly from the junction of the ears as you
rise upward, Secretiveness is larger than Destructiveness; but when the
head becomes narrower as you rise, it is smaller than Destructiveness.</p>

<p>To find these two organs, and their relative size, place the third fingers
of each hand upon the head just at the top of the ears; let the lower side
of the third finger be even with the upper part of the ear; that finger
then rests upon Destructiveness. Then spread the second finger about one
eighth of an inch from the other, and it will rest upon Secretiveness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Let the end of your longest finger come as far forward as the fore part of
the ears, and they will then rest upon these two organs.</p>

<p>Take, next, this same line, starting from the outer angle of the eye, to
the top of the ears, and extend it straight backward an inch and a half to
an inch and three quarters, and you are on Combativeness. This organ
starts about midway to the back part of the ears, and runs upward and
backward toward the crown of the head. To ascertain its relative size,
steady the head with one hand, say the left, and place the balls of your
right fingers upon the point just specified letting your elbow be somewhat
below the subject&#8217;s head, which will bring your fingers directly <span class="smcaplc">ACROSS</span>
the organ. Its size may be ascertained partly from the general fullness of
the head, and partly from its sharpness, according as the organ is more or
less active; yet observers sometimes mistake this organ for the mastoid
process directly behind the lower part of the ears. Remember our rule,
namely: a line drawn from the outer angle of the eye to the top of the
ear, and continued an inch and a half or three quarters straight back.
Follow that rule, and you cannot mistake the position of this organ; and
will soon, by comparing different heads, be able to arrive at those
appearances when large or small.</p>

<p>To find <span class="smcap">Philoprogenitiveness</span>, extend this line straight back to the middle
of the back head, and you are on the organ; and in proportion as the head
projects backward behind the ears at this point, will Philoprogenitiveness
be larger or smaller.</p>

<p>About an inch, or a little less, directly <span class="smcaplc">BELOW</span> this point, is the organ
which controls <span class="smcaplc">MUSCULAR MOTION</span>; and in proportion as this is more or less
prominent, will the muscular system be more or less active. Those who have
this prominence large, will be restless, always moving a hand or foot when
sitting, and even when sleeping; will be light-footed, easy-motioned, fond
of action, and willing to work, and possessed of a first-rate
constitution. But when that prominence is weak, they will be found less
fond of physical action and labor.</p>

<p>To return to Philoprogenitiveness. Three fourths of an inch ABOVE this
point, <span class="smcap">Inhabitiveness</span> is located. When this organ is large, and Continuity
is moderate, there will be found a prominence somewhat resembling an angle
of a triangle, with the angle at the middle of the head, together with a
sharp prominence at this point. But when Inhabitiveness is small, there
will be a depression just about large enough to receive the end of a
finger, with the bow downward. An inch on each side of this point is
<span class="smcap">Adhesiveness</span>. Or thus: taking the backward termination of that line
already drawn, erect upon it a right-angle triangle; let the right angle
be on Philoprogenitiveness, and the two sides which inclose this angle be
about an inch and a half or three quarters each, and the other two angles
will be on the two lobes of Adhesiveness&mdash;the hypothenuse, or long side,
being about two inches, or two and a half inches, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> length. When
Adhesiveness is large&mdash;especially if Inhabitiveness and Continuity be
small&mdash;there will be found two swells, somewhat resembling the larger end
of an egg; but if small, the head will retire at this point.</p>

<p>Directly above Inhabitiveness and Adhesiveness, <span class="smcap">Continuity</span> is located.
When small, a depression resembling a new moon, with the horns turning
<span class="smcaplc">DOWNWARD</span>, surrounding the organs of Inhabitiveness and Adhesiveness, will
be found. When Continuity is large, however, there will be no depression,
nor any swell, but simply a <span class="smcaplc">FILLING OUT</span> of the head at this point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amativeness</span> may be found thus: Take the middle of the back part of the
ears as your starting point; draw a line backward an inch and a half, and
you are upon this organ. Yet the outer portion next to the ear probably
exercises the more gross and animal function of this faculty, while the
inner portion takes on a more spiritual tone.</p>

<p>To find <span class="smcap">Cautiousness</span>, take the back or posterior part of the ears as your
starting point; draw a perpendicular line, when the head is erect, from
the extreme back part of the ear, straight up the side of the head, and
just where the head begins to round off to form the top, Cautiousness is
located. This organ is generally well developed in the American head, and
those swells, generally seen at this point, are caused by a full
development of this faculty.</p>

<p>To find <span class="smcap">Alimentiveness</span>, take the upper and forward junction of the ear
with the head as your starting point; draw a line half an inch forward,
inclining a little downward, and you are upon this organ. Then rise three
quarters of an inch straight upward, and you are on that part of
<span class="smcap">Acquisitiveness</span> which gets property. Yet a better rule for finding it is
this: Find Secretiveness in accordance with the rule already given, and
Acquisitiveness is three quarters of an inch <span class="smcaplc">FORWARD</span> of the point, and
about an inch above the middle of the tip of the ear. Or thus: Take the
middle of the top of the ear as your starting point; draw a perpendicular
line three quarters of an inch upward, and you are on Secretiveness; and
then about an inch forward, and you are on Acquisitiveness. The back part
of Acquisitiveness seeks partnership and <span class="smcaplc">ACQUIRES</span>, while the fore part
<span class="smcaplc">HOARDS</span> money. When the head widens rapidly as you pass from the outer
angles of the eyes to the top of the ears, Acquisitiveness is large; but
when the head is thin in this region, Acquisitiveness is small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sublimity, Ideality</span>, and <span class="smcap">Constructiveness</span>, can be found by the following
rule: First find Cautiousness by applying the rule already laid down for
that purpose, then pass directly forward an inch, and you are on
Sublimity; extend this line on another inch, and you are on Ideality; then
an inch downward brings you upon Constructiveness.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that Cautiousness, Sublimity, and Ideality are
just upon the turning of the head, or between the top and the sides of the
head. Usually the head is much wider at Cautiousness than at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> Sublimity,
and at Sublimity than Ideality. When, however, the head is as wide at
Ideality as at Cautiousness, the subject will be found possessed of
unusual good taste, purity, refinement, elevation, and personal
perfection. Half an inch forward of Ideality is the organ which appertains
to dress, and secures personal neatness. In those who care but little what
they wear, or how they appear, this organ will be found small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firmness</span> can best be found by the following rule: Let the subject sit or
stand erect, and hold the head in a line with the spinal column; then take
the opening of the ear as your starting point, draw a line straight upward
till you reach the middle line on the top of the head, and you are on the
fore part of Firmness. When this organ is large, and Veneration is small,
you will find its forward termination to resemble, in shape, the fore part
of a smoothing-iron, rapidly widening as it runs backward; the organ is
usually about an inch and a half long.</p>

<p>To find <span class="smcap">Self-esteem</span>, take the junction of this perpendicular line with the
middle line of the head, and an inch and a half backward will be found the
upper part of Self-Esteem, which gives a lofty, aspiring air, magnanimity,
and a determination to do something worthy of itself; while half an inch
farther back will be found another part of Self-Esteem, which gives <span class="smcaplc">WILL</span>,
love of liberty, and a determination not to be ruled.</p>

<p>On the two sides of Self-Esteem, about an inch outwardly, <span class="smcap">Approbativeness</span>
is located. These two lobes run backward toward Adhesiveness, and upward
toward Conscientiousness.</p>

<p>The relative size of Approbativeness and Self-Esteem may be found thus:
Place one hand, say the left, upon the forehead, and steady the head;
point the finger from above directly down upon Firmness; then move it two
inches directly backward, and place the balls of the second and third
fingers upon the points just found. If Self-Esteem be small, these balls
will fall into the hole which indicates its deficiency, while the ends of
the fingers will strike upon the swells caused by Approbativeness, if this
organ be large; and the middle of the second joint of these fingers will
apprehend the size of that lobe of Approbativeness which is next to it. Or
thus: Stand behind the patient, and so place your fingers upon his head
that the second finger shall reach upward to the back part of Firmness,
then lay the first and second joints of that finger evenly with the head,
and place the first and third fingers upon the head alongside of it. If
Self-Esteem be larger than Approbativeness, the second finger will be
pushed up farther than the others; but if the two lobes of Approbativeness
be larger than Self-Esteem, the second finger will fall into a hollow
running up and down, while the first and third fingers will rest upon the
two lobes of Approbativeness. Or thus: In nineteen females out of every
twenty, Self-Esteem will be found small and Approbativeness large, and by
applying this rule to their heads, a hollow will generally be found at
Self-Esteem and a swell at Approbativeness, by which you can localize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
these organs; and a few applications will soon enable you to form correct
ideas of their appearance when large or small.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope</span> and <span class="smcap">Conscientiousness</span> are found thus: That line already drawn to find
Firmness passes over the back part of Hope, which is on each side of the
fore part of Firmness, while Conscientiousness is just back of that line,
on the two sides of the back part of Firmness, joining Approbativeness
behind.</p>

<p>As these two organs run lengthwise from Firmness down toward Cautiousness,
and are near together, it is sometimes difficult to say which is large and
which small. The upper part of Conscientiousness, next to Firmness,
experiences feelings of obligation to God, or sense of duty to obey his
laws; while the lower part creates a feeling of obligation to our
fellow-men.</p>

<p>Near the middle of the top of the head is <span class="smcap">Veneration</span>; or about an inch
forward of the point already described for finding Firmness; while
<span class="smcap">Benevolence</span> is about an inch forward of Veneration. When, therefore, the
middle of the top head rounds out and rises above Firmness and
Benevolence, Veneration is larger than either of these organs; but when
there is a swell at Benevolence, and a depression as you pass backward in
the middle of the head, and another rise as you pass still farther back to
Firmness, Veneration is smaller than Benevolence or Firmness. The back of
Benevolence experiences a desire to do good and to remove evil, while the
fore part bestows minor gifts in the family and neighborhood. The fore
part of Veneration gives respect for our fellow-men, while the back part
supplicates and depends upon a Deity. The fore part of Firmness, working
with Conscientiousness, gives moral decision; while the latter, acting
with Self-Esteem, gives physical decision, determination to accomplish
material objects, and what we commonly call perseverance.</p>

<p>On each side of Veneration, <span class="smcap">Spirituality</span> is located. It may be found by
the following rules: Standing behind the subject, who should be seated, so
place your fingers that the first fingers of each hand shall be about an
inch apart&mdash;that the ends of your second fingers shall be about three
quarters of an inch forward of a line drawn across the middle of the head
from side to side, and the balls of your fingers will be on Spirituality.
Or reversing your position, so as to stand in FRONT of the subject, so
place your hands that the first fingers of each hand shall be as before,
about an inch apart, and the ends of your longest fingers shall just touch
the fore part of Hope, and the balls of your second and third fingers will
rest on Spirituality. This organ is generally small, so that it may
usually be found by that depression which indicates its absence. When it
is large, the head is filled out in this region, instead of sloping
rapidly from Veneration. Its two lobes are about an inch on each side of
Veneration, and directly above Ideality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imitation</span> is upon the two sides of Benevolence, directly forward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Spirituality. The best rule for finding it is this: Standing in front of
the subject, place your hands so that the first fingers of each hand shall
be separated about three quarters of an inch, and that the end of your
longest finger shall reach a line drawn through Veneration and
Spirituality&mdash;that is, through the middle of the head from side to
side&mdash;and the balls of your fingers will be on Imitation. It will be found
large, or very large, in almost all children; so that the ridge usually
found in their heads at this point, may be taken as the location of this
organ. It runs from Benevolence downward toward Constructiveness. The
upper part, toward Benevolence, mimics; the lower part, toward
Constructiveness, is <ins class="correction" title="original: the the">the</ins> organ for making after a pattern, copying, etc.</p>

<p>We are now brought to the intellectual lobe. Take the root of the nose as
your starting point; the first organ we meet in passing upward is
<span class="smcap">Individuality</span>. It is between the eyebrows, and when large, causes them to
arch <span class="smcaplc">DOWNWARD</span> at their inner termination.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an inch upward, and slightly below the centre of the
forehead is <span class="smcap">Eventuality</span>, which in children is usually large, and in adults
generally small. From this centre of the forehead, <span class="smcap">Comparison</span> extends
upward to where the head begins to slope backward to form the top of the
head; at which point, or between Benevolence and Comparison, <span class="smcap">Human Nature</span>
is located, which is usually large in the American head, as is also
Comparison. <span class="smcap">Agreeableness</span> is located about an inch on each side of the
organ of Human Nature, and is usually small; so that we can ascertain its
location by observing its deficiency. When both of these organs are large,
the forehead will be wide and full as it rounds backward to form the top
head, or where the hair makes its appearance. <span class="smcap">Causality</span> is located about
an inch on each side of Comparison; and <span class="smcap">Mirthfulness</span> about three quarters
of an inch still farther outwardly toward Ideality. <span class="smcap">Form</span> is located
internally from Individuality, just above and partly between the eyes, so
as to set them wider apart, in proportion as it is larger or smaller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size</span> is located just in the turn between the nose and eyebrows, or beneath
the inner portion of the eyebrows; and when large, causes their inner
portions to project outward over the inner portion of the eyes like the
eaves of a house, giving to the eyes a sunken appearance. Size can
generally be observed by sight, yet if you would test your sight by touch,
proceed as follows: Place the end of your thumb against the bridge of your
nose, with the lower part of your hand turned outward, and your thumb
lying nearly parallel with the eyebrows, and the balls of your thumb will
be upon Size. And if this organ be large, you will observe a fullness in
this region, as if half a bean were beneath your thumb.</p>

<p>To find <span class="smcap">Weight</span> and <span class="smcap">Color</span>, proceed as follows: Let the eyes be directed
straight forward, as if looking at some object; draw an imaginary line
from the middle of the eye to the eyebrow; internally from this line
beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> the eyebrows Weight is located, while Color is located beneath
the eyebrows just outwardly from this line. <span class="smcap">Order</span> is located just
externally to Color; and <span class="smcap">Time</span> is located partly above and between Color
and Order. This organ is small in most heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calculation</span> is located beneath the outer termination of the eyebrows, and
in proportion as they are long and extend backward to the eye, will this
organ be more or less developed. Three fourths of an inch <span class="smcaplc">ABOVE</span> the outer
angle of the eyebrow, <span class="smcap">Tune</span> is located. Spurzheim&#8217;s rule for finding it is
this: Stand directly before the subject, and if the head widens over the
outer eyebrow as you rise upward, Tune is large; but if you observe a
hollow at this point, Tune is small. I have generally found this organ
small in adults, so that it is difficult to find its relative size, but in
children it is very easily found; its decline is consequent on its
non-exercise. Time and Tune join each other, while Time, Tune, and
Mirthfulness occupy the three angles of a triangle, nearly equilateral,
the shortest side being between Time and Tune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Language</span> is located partly above and partly behind the eyes. When it is
large, it pushes the eyes downward and outward, and of course shoves them
forward, which gives them a full and swollen appearance, as if they were
standing partly out of their sockets, and causes both the upper and under
eyelids to be wide and broad. When the eyes are sunken, and their lids
narrow, Language will be found small.</p>

<p>By following these rules exactly and specifically, the precise location of
the organs can be ascertained, and a few observations upon heads will soon
teach you the appearance of the respective organs when they are large,
small, or midway in size. Some slight allowances are to be made, however,
in calculating the size of the head, or the relative size of the organs.
Thus, the larger Combativeness is, the longer the line from Combativeness
to the ear; yet large and small Combativeness do not vary this line over
from a quarter to half an inch; so that there will be but little
difficulty in finding the precise location of this organ.</p>

<p>Probably the most difficult point of discrimination is between Hope and
Conscientiousness, and it should be distinctly borne in mind, that Hope is
generally placed too far forward. Between Hope, Cautiousness, and
Approbativeness, there probably exists an organ, the natural functions of
which has not yet been fully established. There are doubtless other organs
yet undiscovered, especially in the middle line of the head, between
Benevolence and Philoprogenitiveness, and also between Imitation and
Causality. Phrenology is yet in its infancy. Though it is perfect in
itself, yet our <span class="smcaplc">KNOWLEDGE</span> of it is not yet perfected. As every successive
generation make advances upon one another in Astronomy, Chemistry, and
other departments of science, so Gall and Spurzheim have discovered only
the landmarks of this science and have left much to be filled up by us and
those who come after us.</p>
